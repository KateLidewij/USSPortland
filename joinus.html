<section><h1>How to Apply?</h1>
<p>Open positions are listed here. Take a gander and what's being offered, come up with a character concept, then fill out an application form!</p>
<p>Before you apply, however, you should familiarize yourself with a couple things. First, it would be a good idea to read the <a href="rules.html">ground rules</a> of the Portland so you know what you're getting into.</p>
<p>Obsidian Fleet, the simming organization that the Portland is a part of, has a few rules on what sort of characters are allowed. The main ones are:</p>
<p id="code"><code>
1.1.4 Canonical characters are not permitted.</br>
</br>
1.1.5 A player character is not permitted to be one the races listed below. Additions or subtraction to this list may be made by Joint Fleet Command.</br>
</br>
1.1.5.1 Non-Humanoid Races (big rock creatures, Tribbles, etc.)</br> 
1.1.5.2 Q, Iconians, Dowd </br>
1.1.5.3 Androids </br>
1.1.5.4 Borg in the Collective </br>
1.1.5.5 Shapeshifters </br>
1.1.5.6 Jem-Hadar still in the Dominion</br>
1.1.5.7 Vorta still in the Dominion</br>
1.1.5.8 Suliban</br>
1.1.5.9 Species 8472 </br>
1.1.5.10 Augments/Angosians/Genetically engineered individuals (in Starfleet/Marine positions only)</br>
1.1.5.11 Races from non-Star Trek continuities </br>
</br>
1.1.6 Custom races are permitted, but a detailed description of the culture and abilities is required and accepting the player’s character is at the discretion of the sim’s Commanding Officer. 
</code></p>
<p>For custom (non-canon) races, we do allow them and encourage prospective players to get creative, but we have a guide <a href="rules.html#CSG">here</a> that would be a good read before you go making up that bio.</p>
<p>Finally, if you need guidance, it may be a good idea to check out the biographies of some other members of Portland to get an idea of what we're looking for. Biographies don't need to be too long or too detailed, they just need to give the reader a basic idea of your character's history. Really, a basic framework is all that is required; we can flesh out the details of your character's history through play.</p>
<p><b>Now that you're ready to apply, go <a href="app_form.html">here</a> and fill out the application.</b></p>
<p>We'll try to get back to you as soon as we can but definitely within a week. If you are accepted, register for the forums, post your biography in the "Personnel" section, introduce yourself, and start posting!</p></section></div>
