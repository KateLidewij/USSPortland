<h1>Player Mentorship Program</h1>
<p>In order to be successful, the USS Portland is going to have to recruit new players in order to increase the number of writers, fill out the open department head positions, and replace retiring players.
Currently, the Obsidian Fleet Academy offers courses for new players. While this can be useful, it is limited by having little connection to the ship and players are not brought up to speed. Additionally, the pedagogical techniques&nbsp;–&nbsp;having students read a text and submit written answers which are then graded&nbsp;–&nbsp;do not offer much in the way of interactive learning.</p>
<p><b>Objectives:</b><ul>
<li>To teach players the basics of simming</li>
<li>To integrate new players into the USS Portland</li>
<li>To prevent new players from being excluded due to cliquishness</li>
<li>To reduce the learning curve associated with creating a new character</li>
<li>To give new players positive feedback, encouraging them to actively post</li>
<li>To build confidence in new players, so they feel comfortable in advancing the story</li></ul></p>
<p><b>Structure:</b>
<p>All new players will be eligible for this program. Players who are new to simming are especially encouraged to participate. Mentors will be appointed by the CO. If you are interested to become a mentor, let me know. Players will be mentored for a period of two months, unless it is deemed that further mentorship is required.</br>
Additionally, the command staff will endeavor to develop some documentation that can serve as a “handbook” of sorts for new players.</p>
<p><b>Duties of Students:</b><ul>
<li>Review the rules of the Portland</li>
<li>Actively post</li>
<li>Accept feedback from mentors</li></ul></p>
<p><b>Duties of Mentors:</b><ul>
<li>Instruct players in accordance with the principle set out in the rules of the USS Portland</li>
<li>Assist players with introducing their characters in-character, and getting them involved with the story</li>
<li>Engage in in-character interaction with the student</li>
<li>Give positive feedback and constructive criticism</li>
<li>Encourage students to be active posters, and offer assistance where requested or required</li></ul></p></section></div>
