<section><h1>Portland Pulse - Edition 16 (September 2, 2392)</h1>
<p><b>Starfleet Captain Abducted by Borg</b></br><i>Jake Sisko</i></p>
<img src="images/jake.jpg">
<p>Reports from the Bajor Sector suggest some troubling developments. Captain Kate Banninga of the USS Endeavour was kidnapped by the Borg in the line of duty. The Endeavour was in the process of a rescue operation at Nova Europa, when a Borg Cube attacked. Rumors suggest that the Borg seem to have targeted the Captain specifically, and left shortly after taking her.<p>
<p>“While this may seem like strange behaviour,” explained Admiral Kathryn Janeway, Starfleet’s foremost expert on the Borg, “you have to remember that the Borg do not think strategically the same way that we do. They seek to accomplish their primary objectives in the most efficient manner, and if their primary objective was indeed to kidnap a Starfleet captain, it is in line with Borg tactical thinking that they would retreat once that objective had been accomplished.”<p>
<p>Fleet Command has turned to ship over to Commander Marcus Byrne, the former Commanding Officer of the decimated colony. The ship is now docked at Starbase 375 for emergency repairs. Fleet command has also placed the entire sector on high alert in response to Borg activity.<p>
<p>In related news, the Fleet has dispatched the USS Portland to investigate Borg activity in a nebula near the destroyed colony world. The century old ship has been equipped with the latest in experimental technology in what Starfleet hopes to be a successful first test of a new form of energy generation and ship propulsion. While the details of this experimental technology is classified, it is rumoured that the controversial scientist Shras th’Karath is the project leader.<p>

<p><b>USS Asphodel Assigned Patrol Duty</b></br><i>Clark Kent</i></p>
<img src="images/clark.jpg">
<p>The USS Asphodel has been assigned to patrol duties in the Risa sector following a four month repair operation under mysterious circumstances.</p>
<p>Reports around the assignment is currently unknown. However, it is thought to be related to the recent criticisms of Starfleet, and Captain Oliver Lancaster in particular regarding his seeming cowboy methods, by Federation Councillor Pokk Thero and his political ally, Vice Admiral Daphne Zane.</p>
<p>Thero, who has been involved in politics for the last decade, and has always been avidly opposed to the apparent lack of security in Starfleet and the Federation as the whole, citing incidents with the Borg, the Dominion and the So’na, among others.</p>
<p>Reports lead us to believe Captain Lancaster has actually been transferred aboard the new facility in the Risa system, Deep Space 16, in some kind of fleet management role. We reached out to Captain Lancaster, but he declined to comment.</p>

<p><b>Chief Morale Officer’s Report</b></br><i>Acting Ensign Ko-ko</i></p>
<img src="images/koko.jpg">
<p>Well, surprise, surprise, it’s time for another morale report already. This month, the Portland had a total of 37 posts, which is pretty good. The caveat to that is that we count months from the 25th to the 25th for OF reporting purposes, and we had a large number of posts going live after the 25th. So, we’re on track to beat that number this month.</p>
<p>The story continues to move along at a good pace; we’re heading towards the final conflicts in both missions 4 and 5. Once we finish mission 5, we’ll be going into a Joint Mission with the USS Endeavour, which should be exciting.</p>
<p>We also would like to welcome aboard Ray, who plays Ensign Ronald Roberts, our new Assistant Chief Engineering Officer. We’re going to be finding him, along with NPC Ensign Jessica White, in a crippled shuttle en route to the nebula, and integrate him into the crew for the nebula battle.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to congratulate Eric, who plays Tolaran Kian, on stepping into the center chair. As Commander Raktael Kelarna, he’s the new CO of the USS Deimos, a Steamrunner class vessel which some may remember as a former sister ship of the Portland. A fun fact about Eric is that 15 years ago, he was the original TFCO of TF72, and it’s exciting to see him jump into the center chair again. We wish Eric and all the crew of the Deimos best of luck in their adventures ahead!</p>

<p><b>Better Know A Player</b></br><i>Marcus Kallan</i></p>
<p>For this installment of our long-running series “better know a player,” I interviewed Alexander, who plays Marcus Kallan, our friendly Chief Operations Officer</p>
<p>Q: Tell us a little about the player behind Marcus.</p>
<p>I’m in my early 40s, living in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area. I’ve been here for over fifteen years, having grown up in the shadow of New York City out on Long Island. I’m a software engineer by trade. When I’m not converting caffeine into code, I’m a husband, tabletop and online gamer, music lover, and general all-around sci-fi nerd.</p>
<p>Q: How did you get into Star Trek?</p>
<p>I was introduced to it by my father from a very young age. I cried terribly in the movie theater when Spock died. As cliche-sounding as this is, it’s been an integral part of me throughout my life. I’ve never gone to a Trek convention, though, so maybe not that integral.</p>
<p>Q: And how about simming? I believe the Portland is your first simm?</p>
<p>Indeed it is. I’ve never played on a simm before, although I have had my share of text-based roleplaying games (called MUSHes, generally), some of them even in the Star Trek universe. My first online Star Trek-based RPG experience was back in 2000 – 2001 on a game called Anomaly TrekMUX. It is long gone, but it was a great game. I’ve since played on half a dozen different online Trek games, but nothing ever quite as good as Anomaly… until the Portland, that is! The quality on the USS Portland, and in Task Group 72 in general, seems to be quite good. I’m very happy I found you guys. (d’awww….)</p>
<p>Q: What is your favourite part about simming?</p>
<p>While the demands for quality posting is high (correct grammar and spelling, matching the preferred prose of your fellow posters, coming up with something interesting for all parties involved, etc.) it’s actually quite a relaxing experience. Also, the wonderful part about forum-based RP is that you don’t have to pack as much information into one paragraph as possible, unlike MUSHing; I feel that I can alter other writers’ sentences and paragraphs to create a flowing narrative that you would expect to see in a novel. That’s rather refreshing. Lastly, there’s a certain degree of trust that I’ve come to expect in other players, something that I’ve not experienced frequently on other text-based RPGs; I find that refreshing and inspiring.</p>
<p>Q: Marcus is quite the interesting character, and had to deal with some severe trauma in childhood, being orphaned at Wolf 359. How does that continue to affect him today?</p>
<p>It’s driven him to be the technological and mathematical whiz that he is today, as if through better understanding of cybernetics and AI he could “defeat” the Borg in such a way that would vindicate the losses he felt as a child. It’s also made him a bitter and sarcastic person, tragically, and through some foreshadowing in the Future Portland plot we see what Marcus ultimately could become. Fortunately, he has the Portland to back him up!</p>
<p>Q: Aside from this childhood incident, what else makes Marcus tick?</p>
<p>He is mathematical by nature, deconstructing problems in an almost Vulcan-like mathematical way in order to understand them. Of course, not being a Vulcan means he’s still quite emotional at times, and that can get in the way of objective thinking. He’s fascinated with holographic technology (thus his stewarding of Holo-Meru) and artificial intelligence as a whole — beyond the Borg. His man-crush would probably be Lt. Commander Data, were he still functional. (He also has issues with accepting sentience in AI, but that could just be Maddox’s influence. We’ll see how he evolves!)</p>
<p>Outside of work… well, he has a fragile constitution, preferring to eat very simple TOS-era protein and carbohydrate cubes. He likes getting lost in holo-novels, although he prefers serious re-enactments to adventure or horror. He will probably be found during his off-hours crawling around Jeffries’ tubes, performing engineering tasks or tinkering (much to Ms. Barclay’s irritation, I’m sure.)</p>
<p>Q: Do you have any plans for Marcus in the future? New interests, or a possible romance in the cards?</p>
<p>Well, in the spirit of Trek, Marcus starts out as a fairly two-dimensional character, and I hope becomes enriched and changed by his experiences. As I mentioned before, we saw the dark destiny of Marcus, and hopefully he will be able to avoid that future. As a human, I’m sure he will ultimately get dragged begrudgingly during off-duty hours into new experiences.</p>
<p>As far as romances, there was some subtext between Future Marcus and Future Sera, but nothing’s written in stone — and then there’s the fact that he does like holograms and AI, after all, so we’ll have to see.</p>
<p>Q: Can you tell us about the inspiration behind the recently-deceased alt-future version of Marcus?</p>
<p>My ideas came about in two ways. First, I wanted to manifest some of the darkness that is a part of the character, in that his obsession with technology ultimately becomes his only venue of existence. The “tragic accident” that happened in the past is yet to be elaborated upon, but it is no doubt tied to the “restore Alenis Meru” plotline.</p>
<p>The other idea I had for a sacrifice came about when thinking about other “potential future” plotlines we’ve seen in various Trek media. And what better way to write for an alternate timeline than to have a tragically dark character redeem himself through sacrifice?</p>
<p>Q: Can you tell us what other characters you have in Obsidian Fleet and tell us a little about them?</p>
<p>Sure can! First there’s Lieutenant JG Zhuang Fotu, a half-Bajoran half-human security officer aboard the USS Endeavour. He was part of the colony that the Borg ransacked, and under command of Commander Marcus Byrne (hi, Sera! *waves*) has joined the crew of the Endeavour. Fotu is deeply spiritual, having studied with monks from the traditions of both the Bajoran Prophets and of Buddhism on Earth, and has found a curious blend between the two. He is calm, kind, and gentle, a sort of contradiction for a guy whose job it is to blow stuff up and shoot at people.</p>
<p>Then there’s Ensign Ranna Chamai’u, a half-Orion half-Vulcan Ensign aboard the USS Nightingale. She was rescued from Orion space in her adolescence, a child of slavery and street urchin-esque crime; after bouncing from foster home to foster home, ended up getting adopted by a Starfleet Commander, ultimately naturalizing as a Federation citizen, and entering Starfleet. She’s somewhat dry, has a manipulative streak, and is probably the galaxy’s least-sexualized Orion.  </p>
<p>Lastly there’s my newest character, which really hasn’t gotten off the ground yet: Lieutenant Anatrie Kheim. A Ktarian with a bit of human heritage, she lives in the shadow of the stigma of her great aunt Elena Jol, who tried to commandeer the USS Enterprise. Not only that, but she’s a recovered addict — decadence being acceptable in Ktarian culture but not necessarily the Federation as a whole. She’s cheerful and a skilled diplomat, and looking forward to her first command-level position.</p>
<p>Q: Fascinating. These characters are all quite diverse. What is your process for creating characters, and how do you choose what species of character to create?</p>
<p>It’s really what strikes my fancy at any given time, to be perfectly honest. I’ve always been good at coming up with the basics of a character, which is probably why I enjoy running tabletop RPGs. Mostly, I try to come up with some kind of “compare and contrast” idea, wiggle it into the universe or setting I’m working with, and go from there. As an example, Fotu’s creation stems from my appreciation of Asian culture. His “compare” element is his religion — the balance between two alien faiths; his “contrast” element is the deliberate scripting of him being a wise and peaceful person despite leading a successful career in a violent profession.</p>
<p>As far as species goes, I try to pick something that fits the core concept. Fotu was easy, as he’s a child of two worlds. Ranna’s concept started with her racial breakdown and a vague idea for “criminal’s child gone straight”. Anatrie took me completely by surprise; I really hadn’t considered the Ktarians prior, but established canon seems to allow for a cultural history suggesting hedonistic tendencies (the Ktarian Game, a variety of rich desserts and alcohols, etc.) so I just ran with it. I hope I can help establish Ktarian canon for OF.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not the character’s concept holds water and can be written for? That just takes time. I may not be playing any of these characters weeks or months from now if I determine their concept is strained or just not working. And that’s okay.</p>
<p>Q: You’ve recently decided to move into an Executive Officer role on the brand new USS Deimos. Do you have any plans being hatched for the Deimos?</p>
<p>I need to sit down and work things out with her CO, but I have already made the suggestion that the Deimos be one of those rapid-response, first-arrival vessels for tense diplomatic situations that requires an immediate Starfleet and/or Federation presence. We’ll see how she shapes up!</p>
<p>Q: Last question – we just have to know – what is your favourite Star Trek series, movie and captain?</p>
<p>My favorite series is Deep Space Nine. The breadth of character development, the careful balance between Federation law, Starfleet regulations, and the cultural chaos of the Bajoran sector made for a compelling story. I also enjoyed the more serial, overarching plot of episodes, which started around season three (if I recall correctly).</p>
<p>Favorite movie is First Contact. “You’re blended, all right.” And, “The line must be drawn here, no further! And I will make them pay for what they’ve done!” ‘nuff said!</p>
<p>And finally, favorite Captain? While Sisko definitely got things done, and Kirk’s punching his way through the universe has its appeal, I’m most definitely a fan of Sir Patrick Stewart. Picard, for the win!</p>
