<p><b>USS Portland wins Gold Unit of Merit Award</b></br><i>Rostrenen T'Sering</i></p>
<img src="images/rostrenen.jpg">
<p>Adding to their collection of Silver and Bronze awards, the USS Portland is the winner of the Gold Unit of Merit Award for November.  Unit of Merit awards are awarded every month, and the Gold is the highest Unit of Merit award in Obsidian Fleet, with only one being issued per month.</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Berel Joon of the Obsidian Fleet Office of Fleet Services issued the following prepared statement:</p>
<p><i>The Portland is a continually successful sim and has won many awards, including Silver and Bronze Unit of Merit multiple times. She serves as a prime example of simming in Obsidian Fleet. Thus it is with great pleasure that we add this month to her long list – the Gold award for November. Congratulations, and here’s to many more awards!</i></p>

<p><b>Chief Morale Officer’s Report</b></br><i>Acting Ensign Ko-ko</i></p>
<img src="images/koko.jpg">
<p>December was a great month for the USS Portland!  We had 76 posts, which is a solid number.  Of course, more importantly, we’re moving forward with the mission and have started the big final battle scene for Mission Six.</p>
<p>We also added two new members to the Portland family, our Chief of the Boat, MCPO Gregory Paladin, and our Assistant Chief Security Officer, Ensign Ash Sullivan.  This brings our crew count up to 17, which is an impressive (if difficult to manage…) number.  Please take the initiative to welcome our new crew members and shower them with JPs, as well as help them get involved with the story.</p>
<p>The Command Staff has also been planning out Mission Seven, which will involve an AI symposium held on Trill during their Ice Festival.  It will be part shore leave, part symposium, and part action, so start thinking about what your character might want to do during his or her down time.</p>
<p>Finally, we’d like to welcome future Star Trek fan Thomas to the galaxy. Welcome, Thomas!</p>

<p><b>Captain’s Corner: 2015 – Year in Review</b></br><i>Captain Alenis Meru</i></p>
<img src="images/alenis.jpg">
<p>Well, it’s out with the old and in with the new, which means it’s time for a retrospective on 2015 on the USS Portland.  And what an exciting year it has been!  Over the past year we have, busted up a group of pah-wraith cultists, killed the Captain and brought her back, got to see our future selves, investigated a nebula crawling with Borg, headed back to the nebula to save the quadrant.</p>
<p>And on top of that, we had a lot of great moments – life and death, love and loss, and future revelations.  These are all great stories, and I’m constantly amazed at how much our characters have grown over the time we’ve had together.</p>
<p>In terms of numbers, I haven’t calculated any averages, but I would say that our posting numbers have steadily increased throughout the year.  We’re now putting out well over 50 and sometimes over 100 posts per month.  We’ve also seen a number of crew members come and go are now at 17 members on the Portland, which is a lot!</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes we made this year was the changeover of the website to our new host.  This also necessitated a change from proboards to phpbb, as we had wanted to host our own forum and website and had started to outgrow the features of proboards.  Aside from a few hiccups, this went fairly smoothly, and we now have a forum that we can truly call our own.</p>
<p>Also on the back end, we changed the website over to a wordpress based site.  This site is not only more attractive, but it’s easier for us to keep up to date.  Finally, we’ve started building a wiki for reference material on the Portlandverse that has accumulated over several missions.</p>
<p>I’m continually impressed by what we’ve accomplished here on the Portland.  I believe we’re one of the best simms in the fleet, and that’s all thanks to all of you.</p>
<p>Finally, I have a sneak peek for what we might see in 2016: New relationships!, The arrival of Andy!, Shore leave on Trill, Encounters with the Breen, The return of Vike.</p>
<p>Happy New Year to all members of the USS Portland, and let’s see what we can accomplish in 2016!</p>

<p><b>Quotes of the Month</b></p>
<p>“…-but I see you’re set in your ways.” He sighed, quietly, rubbing his hair again. “Anyway, I don’t know these posts, nor their commanders, but one stuck out. One called the Portland. Something to consider. They’ve got an opening that’ll fit your bill, Gregory. Lot of action their way, too. Maybe it’ll help clear things up.”</br>– <i>Captain John Arrow, to MCPO Gregory Paladin</i>
<p>“I think we’ve all read our history and know about the battle of Wolf 359. If Locasta is able to get her transwarp gate online, this could be the end of not just the Federation, but the entire quadrant.”</br>– <i>Admiral Washington</i>
<p>“Killing Locasta does nothing, Captain… She’s a mouthpiece, nothing more. The Borg collective consciousness is distributed evenly throughout every drone. If anything, we should aim to capture her and use her command pathways to shut down the Borg’s efforts in this quadrant with a minimal loss of allied forces. We can’t hope to stand up against that size of an armada without tricks.”</br>– <i>Marcus Kallan</i></p>
<p>“Admiral, the holo-emitters in this section are down for maintenance. They have been all day.”</br>“So? Why do I care about maint– But if the holo-emitters are down, that means…”</br>“It means I’m the real Alenis Meru, commanding officer of the USS Portland”</br>– <i>A yeoman, Admiral Washington, and Alenis Meru</i></p>
<p>“Forgive me, I am but a simple scientist, so could someone explain to me how exactly we intend to destroy the whole Borg transwarp system?”</br>“I think this is where I come into the mix.”</br>– <i>Jason Beauvoir and Sera Williams</i></p>
<p>“Captain Alenis, it has been a while. And here I thought you were dead.”</br>“I was.”</br>– <i>Gul Jatok and Alenis Meru</i></p>
<p>“You let this… patak speak to your husband in this manner.”</br>“Judith is my sister! You must be confused, old man, she was never married! Now, stand down and apologize for bothering her!”</br>“It seems your sister hasn’t told you all about her visit to the Empire.”</br>– <i>General Mar’dok and Timothy Rouse</i></p>
<p>And now here Ron was, the young engineer who in short time had almost gotten blown up by the Borg and stranded in space for the rest of his short life, now finding himself at the head of the engineering department and in charge of both repairing and dismantling an ageing wreck of a vessel. He couldn’t help but shake his head. He knew exactly where he was: Poop Creek.</br>– <i>Ronald Roberts</i></p>
<p>“Dark matter ejection.” It sounded so scientific and beautiful. Like some sort of rare cosmic occurrence to be cataloged by the ship’s science team. But for the Portland the term was a little closer to home than some far out natural occurrence.</br>– <i>Ronald Roberts</i></p>
<p>“If I may be honest, ma’am, I’m not here to further my resume. Captain Arrow has, repeatedly, offered me a position as commander on his ship. I’ve repeatedly decline – personal reasons which I do not feel inclined to mention, though which he is keenly aware of. He mentioned your ship not because of what it could offer, but because of what it didn’t offer – memories. I’m here to get over a few things from back during the war, ma’am.”</br>– <i>Gregory Paladin</i></p>
<p>“No, we don’t get extra banana cubes for stealing banana cubes. I can’t say–what is that even?”</br>– <i>Novia Yenn</i></p></section></div>
