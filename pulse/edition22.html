<p><b>Borg Incursion Repelled</b></br><i>Rostrenen T'Sering</i></p>
<img src="images/rostrenen.jpg">
<p>A Borg incursion into the Alpha Quadrant has been repelled by a combined Federation-Klingon-Cardassian task force.  Reports indicate that the Borg had been secretly constructing a transwarp conduit in the NGC-3814 nebula near Trill. The Borg invasion force was led by Locasta of Borg, an assimilated Captain Kate Banninga from the USS Endeavour.</p>
<p>“We managed to break Captain Banninga free from the collective,” said Eahar R’Soll, the first officer of the USS Endeavour. “Kate was able to order the Borg to power down before being disconnected.</p>
<p>The USS Portland, a Miranda-class vessel under the command of Captain Alenis Meru, entered the transwarp conduit and collapsed it from the inside.  Details of how this was done are top-secret, however we have discovered that the mercurial Commander Shras was testing a prototype reactor on the Portland immediately prior to the discovery of the Borg.</p>
<p>“The crew of the Portland showed honour befitting a Klingon warrior,” boasted General Mar’dok, the commander of the Klingon forces, over a mug of bloodwine.  “Everyone fought bravely, even the Cardassians.”</p>
<p>Thousands of drones, powered down and disconnected from the collective, remain near the nebula.  A number of ships have been dispatched to the nebula for cleanup and de-assimilation.</p>

<p><b>New CO for USS Deimos</b></br><i>Clark Kent</i></p>
<img src="images/clark.jpg">
<p>According to Fleet scuttlebutt, The USS Deimos’ encounter with the previously unknown Varrikk ended poorly. Apparently, the recently refit ship was towed back to Starbase One for re-inspection, as the crew narrowly escaped a violent response from the territorial Varrikk because of ship-wide malfunctions during a critical time. Starfleet has chosen to have her CO fall on the proverbial sword, reassigning Commander Raktael Kelarna and promoting his former XO, Lieutenant Commander Anatrie Kheim, to the big chair. Let’s hope that the Deimos’ re-refit goes smoothly, and the Varrikk are patient enough to wait for them to be spaceworthy…</p>

<p><b>Chief Morale Officer’s Report</b></br><i>Acting Ensign Ko-ko</i></p>
<img src="images/koko.jpg">
<p>It’s been two months since my last report, and there is a lot to talk about!</p>
<p>The most exciting news is the Obsidian Fleet Simm of the Year award.  Out of the dozens of simms in the fleet, the Portland was chosen as Simm of the Year for 2015!  This is a great honour, and is a result of the efforts of the entire crew, so you should all be very proud.  Secondly, we also just passed the simm’s second anniversary, which is a huge achievement in and of itself.  Many simms don’t even last six months, and we’ve been going strong for two years with no end in sight.</p>
<p>The CO was being naughty earlier this month and made an April Fools joke.  The joke was so successful that the Portland almost lost a player to it.  Rest assured, we have no plans to transition the Portland to STO.
<p>We continue to put out dozens of posts per month.  Our average dipped a little bit in March, however with the big battle scene in M6 being posted, we’ve already rebounded from that for our April numbers.  We added a couple new players, but unfortunately lost a player or two.  However, we remain at a good crew level, with all department head positions filled and a few additional crew as well.</p>
<p>We finally wrapped up the massive battle scene in Episode 6.  All that is left is to tie up any loose ends at the victory party, and we’re done the mission!  Episode 7 is starting to get rolling.  As it’s a shore leave mission, and the CO is going to be away at the spa, you all have lots of freedom to incorporate your ideas and make this mission as exciting as possible.  It’s up to you to take the lead on the plot on this one, and you can do whatever you want, so long as it is awesome.</p>
<p>And, so long as we get our hands on a Breen ship for our next mission…</p>

<p><b>Webmaster's Update</b></br><i>Timothy Rouse</i></p>
<img src="images/rouse.jpg">	
<p>Starting with this issue I want to write a short update about the wiki. Which has been recently named the Portlandverse. Over the last few months work has continued to expand the content of the wiki. Besides the usual updates on the Manifest, the following sections and articles have been created.</p>
<p>Mission pages. They are still a work in progress. The idea is that they will give you a quick overview of a past mission as well as find link to information you might need in future mission. Our first mission also contains a PDF version of the full mission that you can download, in case you want to read the whole mission back.</p>
<p>I’ve also published content I had created for another vessel. It’s background information for Stellar Cartography. The content itself comes from an external source and can be very useful in our stories. The pages are about Nebula, Planetary, Spectral classification. I’ve also published a page containing Maps of the Galaxy and a page about different kind of probes.</p>
<p>Jason Beauvoir also created content for the wiki. His characters: Jason, Jena, T’Lisa, Angela and Zirra. As well as a page for the USS Canterbury.</p>
<p>As this is the first webmaster update in the pulse I could highlight many more new articles, but then this update wouldn’t have an end. Next time I’ll tell about other articles, and hopefully new articles that have been created since the publishing of this issue of the Pulse.</p>
<p>Do you want to create content for the Wiki, just like Jason did, I encourage you to mail me. I’ll then create an account for you and you can help us make this Portlandverse even bigger.</p>

<p><b>A Visitor's Guide to Trill</b></br><i>Novia Yenn</i></p>
<img src="images/novia.jpg">	
<p>Trill is a cool, temperate world in the Trill sector of the United Federation of Planets. It lies somewhat closer to Cardassia Prime and Zenkath than it is to Earth. The planet has a blue-green sky and purple oceans. Trill has a higher than usual frequency of tectonic activity, likely the product of two large moons. Days are 31 hours long and there are 319.5 Trill days in each year. The planet itself is rich in metals and ores due to the tectonic activity.</p>
<p>It is home to a pair of sentient lifeforms. A bipedal humanoid descended from marsupials known as the Trill and a small, long lived subterranean dwelling lifeform resembling a conical serpent referred to as the symbionts. The two species are capable of entering in a symbiotic co-existence. Once joined they are mutually dependent after only 93 hours. The host can no longer survive without the symbiont. The symbiont during its lifetime can take many different hosts and retains the memories of all of them. When joined successfully the pair operate as a single consciousness much like networked computers. Joined improperly the symbiont can completely overwhelm its host. The symbiont eventually returns to the pools permanently to evolve into the next phase of its lifecycle, known as the Annuated.</p>
<p>The first joining occurred in Trill’s pre-history, more than 23,000 years ago, the memories of which may still exist deep underground in the most ancient of evolved symbionts. As Trill culture evolved more stable joinings, the symbionts long lives led to a more focused societal growth. Trill society was based on achievement in the sciences and treasured knowledge above all else and was marked by a surprising lack of conflict.</p>
<p>The Trill had three different phases of expansion into space. The first some 5,000 years ago led to the establishment of a half dozen colony worlds and was halted by a great tragedy the annihilated the colony world of Kurl and left its surface uninhabitable. The shock to the Trill led to a decline eventually leading to long period of cultural introspection and the remaining Trill worlds gradually lost contact with each other. One of the Trill colonies was later infected with the augment virus and though still Trill is a visually distinctive subspecies with ridged foreheads and lacking the distinctive leopard style spotting of the Traditional Trill.</p>
<p>Two major factors contributed to the rise of Trill technology: the memories of symbionts, and easy access to ores and heavy metals. The symbionts could communicate with the humanoid Trills through Joining, although the ways and means of the first Joining remain shrouded in secrecy by the Trill Symbiosis Commission. Symbionts passed from host to host but retained their memories and friendships, and kept Trill society centered on a long-term view. Geologically, the planet Trill’s heavy tectonic activity led to the formation of quake caverns and eroded tunnels, through which the Trill could easily gain access to deposits of iron, aluminum, and other useful metals. The combination of the two factors led to the rapid rise of technology.</p>
<p>The Trills second foray into space was fueled by an industrial revolution on Trill. Unchecked growth fueled by the invention of gravitic tectonic regulation and weather control led the Trill back out into space and the rediscovery of their colony worlds. The industrial rise however led to an ecological catastrophe that poisoned much of the symbionts’ habitat. Joining became mandatory for the survivors as only the very deepest pools were spared the destruction.</p>
<p>Sweeping controls over the planets ecology were imposed and it would be another five hundred years before regular space travel would resume. Contact with the Vulcans would follow shortly after that, though Trill would remain independent for another few centuries before joining the Federation.</p>
<p>As Trill society grew, their governments adopted a system influenced by the symbionts. The symbiont populations grew much more slowly than the humanoid Trill populations, so many Trills competed to have the right qualifications to be selected as a host. This general competitiveness showed through academic achievement and philosophical development—the symbionts made it clear that they would reject violent individuals who tried to become hosts by force. As a result, all Trill civilization stressed a high level of education and ethical personal responsibility. By the time they had covered all of their planet’s landmasses, the Trill already had a unified world government, a meritocracy run through systems of examinations and scientific appointments. This system was well in place by the time the Trill met the Federation, but matters were still cool between the two powers. Trills valued their independence and their position as a neutral party. Over the exchange of several decades, it became clear that the Federation stood for the same high values that Trill society encouraged—and that the members of the Federation had embraced those values, due to long years of struggle and learning, having worked hard to establish what came naturally to Trill culture. Eventually, the Trill applied for and received Federation membership in one of the fastest turnaround times from application to completion.</p>
<p>Trill is a temperate world much like earth though generally more mountainous and cooler on average. It has about 38% landmass and four major continents, one of which is situated at the southern pole and covered in ice. Another of which comprises more than half of the total landmass of the planet. Since the development of global tectonic and weather control, Trill society has gathered in metropolitan areas of tall domed buildings each surrounded by a few agrarian townships. The majority of the land has been left wild to maintain a balance between technology and nature.
<p>Society revolves around academic success, family prestige is gained through academic and scientific achievement and especially through the awarding of symbionts. The competition for between three to four hundred annual joinings can be intense and only the best and brightest are even considered.</p>
<p>Life on Trill is a showcase of modern convenience with all off the technological achievement of modern Federation science. With strips of nature incorporated into even the largest of Trill cities one is never far from peaceful stretches of green. Outside the cities long stretched of unbroken wilderness beckon to those looking for a bit of a break from modern life.</p>
