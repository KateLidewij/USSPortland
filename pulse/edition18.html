<section><h1>Portland Pulse - Edition 18 (November 2, 2392)</h1>
<p><b>Starbase 47 Missing!</b></br><i>Jenna Quinn</i></p>
<p>Earlier today, at 0910 hours, Galactic standard time, Starbase 47 suddenly disappeared from all deep space monitoring systems. For those of you unaware, Starbase 47 was recently re-activated, under the command of Captain Oliver Lancaster, former Commanding Officer of the starship Asphodel, as well as, for a brief period, Chief of Starfleet Operations for the Risa sector.</p>
<p>While the Federation News Service has so far been unable to find out the cause of this apparent disappearance, we have been able to confirm that the disappearance of the starbase is not limited to Starfleet telemetry; according to our sources in the Klingon High Command and the Ferengi Alliance, following the request by Starfleet that they scan for the station, they have also found no trace of it.</p>
<p>The correspondent for Starfleet Command was able to sit down with Commander Jackson Quince, attaché to Admiral Daphne Zane. The Commander had the following to say;</p>
<p>“Currently, we have no leads on the disappearance of Starbase 47. While this is, of course, distressing for all of us, we have to maintain our decorum, and do our best to try to find the crew, or, heavens forbid, those responsible for the crew’s demise. To this end, Admiral Zane has had the Intrepid sent to the last known location of the starbase in the Telverian Corridor to investigate.”</p>
<p>The fact that Starfleet is only sending a single ship to investigate the disappearance of such a colossal facility as the Stardock-class starbase is slightly peculiar. However, given reports of strange energy emissions coming from the vicinity of Barzan II, formerly the location of the exit aperture of a Wormhole connected to a region of the Delta Quadrant relatively close to Borg territory, it is possible that those reports have been given higher priority. We will provide more information on those events as they become available.</p>
<p>On a related note, Federation Councilman Pokk Thero has wasted no time in using both reports as an opportunity to try to push his proposals for the further militarisation of Starfleet through the Federation Council. At a conference earlier today, following an emergency session of the Council, Mr. Thero said the following;</p>
<p>“It is truly regrettable that we have had to lose Starbase 47 today. I know Captain Lancaster personally, and while I make no secret that I am not fond of the man, it is always regrettable when we lose Federation citizens to the unknown. I hope that, in light of this, the Federation Council will see fit to grant more powers to Starfleet, in order that they may better defend themselves against exactly this kind of situation!”</p>
<p>Mr. Thero’s comments were met with mixed responses. However, the Federation Council and top Starfleet Admiralty are expected to meet in two weeks time in Paris to discuss the matter of a more militarised Starfleet. We shall report more on this as the story develops.</p>

<p><b>Retraction: Obituaries</b></br><i>Portland Pulse Editorial Board</i></p>
<p>In a recent edition of the Portland Pulse, we had printed an obituary for Captain Alenis Meru of the USS Portland. Subsequent events have shown that the printing of this obituary was premature. We regret the error.</p>

<p><b>Chief Morale Officer’s Report</b></br><i>Acting Ensign Ko-ko</i></p>
<img src="images/koko.jpg">
<p>Boo! Happy Halloween! I hope you all had a wonderfully spooky time. I spent the evening as part of a costume; Meru wanted to go as a pirate and apparently a bird on the shoulder completes the outfit.</p>
<p>October was another excellent month. We had 75 posts and welcomed a new crew member, Lieutenant (JG) Skot Petryr, a medical officer with a specialty in treating burns and radiation poisoning. Everyone is encouraged to give Skot a warm welcome, and try not to overwhelm him with too many tales of our weird Bajoran religious experiences.</p>
<p>More than just the post count, we’ve wrapped up Mission Five and just need to get a couple more things posted to finish Mission Four. It’s always an satisfying moment when we wrap up a mission and start a new one, and reviewing what we’ve written over the months gives me a unique sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>We’re starting up Episode Six. This takes place shortly after Episode Five, and we’ll be teaming up with the crew of the Endeavour and some NPC starships to end the Borg threat and save the Alpha Quadrant. The Endeavour crew will be coming to our forum to post, so please give them a nice warm Portland welcome.</p>
<p>That’s all for now! Let’s show the fleet what a successful Joint Mission looks like!</p>

<p><b>Better Know a Sister Ship - USS Galileo</b></p>	
<p>Since none of you players volunteered to get Better Known, we’re doing something a little different this month. It is my pleasure to interview Jay, aka Rear Admiral Lirha Saalm of the USS Galileo. The Galileo is a former flagship of Task Group 72A and is currently the flagship of Task Force 21, and is also a sister ship of the USS Portland.</p>
<p>Q: All successful simms seem to have a concept, and yours is a planetary science simm. How did you come up with this, and what does it mean?</p>
<p>A: Thanks for having me! USS Galileo’s current iteration is really just a product of circumstance. When I first applied for command in early 2012, I was offered the choice between one of two sims – a Defiant-class (USS Liberator) or a Nova-class (USS Galileo). Obviously the two ship classes are worlds apart and operate in their own special niche, so I contemplated whether or not to run a science vessel or a tactical one. The answer came pretty quickly to me; I wanted a sim that would be able to replicate the core values and ethos of the Trek franchise (exploration, science, and discovery), and a Nova-class was best suited to the job.</p>
<p>After I decided on the ship class, I wanted to do something fun and unique with the sim. Something to make it stand out from the rest of the Trek games on the internet. I began to look closer at the Nova-class and what this little ship was capable of doing, and as it turns out, a Nova-class is by definition a survey vessel which also possesses planetary landing capability. The idea for a planetary science specialization soon popped into my head and it went perfectly hand-in-hand with the class of ship I had chosen.</p>
<p>In practice, this specialization means that Galileo has a unique mission profile to which the majority of our missions adhere. In descending order of priority, the Nova-class mission profile is:</p>
<p><ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>1: Provide a platform for extended scientific survey and scouting missions.</li>
<li>2: Replace the Oberth for system and planetary survey missions.</li>
<li>3: Provide autonomous capability for full execution of Federation defensive, cultural, scientific, and explorative policy in deep space or border territory.</li>
<li>4: Serve as a front-line support vehicle during emergencies and a platform for the extension of Federation diplomacy and policy.</li>
<li>5: Provide non-critical functions such as transport of personnel and cargo when necessary, extended aid, and short-range patrol.</li></ul></p>
<p>Q: The Galileo has been running for a few years. Tell me a little about the history of the Galileo.</p>
<p>A: Galileo’s history under my command started in January 2012. We’ve been running operational for almost four years and we’re still having a great time writing with each other and crafting our stories. Before my tenure, Galileo was under the command of Captain Radcliffe and Captain Stark. Both did an excellent job of running their versions of the sim and keeping the legacy intact.</p>
<p>Q: During that history, do you have any favourite missions in particular?</p>
<p>A: All of our missions have a special place in my heart. We – the crew – have worked so hard and written great RP for every one of our adventures, so it’s hard for me to pick a favorite without undermining the other missions and player contributions. But…if I had to choose one or two, it would be Episode 01 (Project Sienna) and Episode 04 (Exodus). And Episode 06 (Legend of Souls). Those three missions pretty much embody our sim’s writing style and storytelling methods.</p>
<p>Q: The crew of the Galileo is currently trapped in the Mirror Universe and the ship is being boarded by Terran soldiers. Tell me about your current mission, and if our heroes are going to be able to find their way out of this.
<p>A: Your synopsis speaks for itself. No spoilers!</p>
<p>Q: You have over twenty players and at one point had over thirty, and many of those players have multiple NPCs which are treated as secondary PCs. What sort of challenges arise from having such a large crew?</p>
<p>A: I could probably do an entire research project about the obstacles of running a large internet-based writing RPG, but to keep my thoughts concise, I will say it is indeed a challenge. Each writer is unique and brings their own personality to our sim. Every time we receive an application, we try our best to make sure each player will be a proper fit for our group and have the opportunity to express themselves in a fun and welcoming environment. Not every applicant is accepted to our game, but those who show an enthusiasm for the core values of Trek along with strong writing skills and good maturity are usually the best candidates.</p>
<p>As far as challenges go, administrating such a big group is perhaps the most prominent roadblock. Each player requires individual attention for their characters and subplots which means we have to invest a substantial amount of time to make sure everyone is happy and enjoying the sim’s experience. This challenge grows with each additional player who joins our game.</p>
<p>Q: The Galileo’s posting numbers are almost unheard of in Obsidian Fleet. What is your secret to having 100+ posts a month while other CO’s struggle to get more than one or two dozen?</p>
<p>A: Thanks for the compliment! We do have an active sim and I think that is one of our strengths. The entire reason I started this game was due to a lack of other active sims on the internet. I’ve done ‘the dance’ for years here in OF and BF, bouncing around from sim to sim trying to find a place for my characters. Unfortunately, ¾ of the time I would join a dead sim or a slow sim that appeared to be active but really wasn’t, and this meant I was never able to develop my characters and enjoy the simming experience. I had to constantly transfer my characters between different sims in the hope that the next game would be more active, and each time I transferred, I was essentially starting over with my character. “It was…frustrating, to fight Starfleet” (Gen. Karn, Axanar).</p>
<p>With Galileo, I wanted to create a place where the plot moved quickly and characters were able to progress in order to allow us to develop our characters without frustration or delay. I wanted to foster an environment of character security where all players could come and write not only one, but multiple characters while also moving the timeline along to allow in-character progression and maturation. I think we’ve done a good job of this over the years, and it helps our players feel confident and enthusiastic about writing (which in turn generates more posts).</p>
<p>There is no secret, really, aside from a CO’s sim activity desire. If a CO wants an active game, they should set their sim activity rules accordingly and also lead by example by posting frequently. They should also be moving the sim’s timeline along at a good pace to prevent stagnation.</p>
<p>Q: If you were advising a new CO looking to replicate your success, what would you say to him or her?</p>
<p>It’s blood in, blood out, like most things in life. Put the time and effort into your game and you will see immediate results. Lead by example and have a vision for your sim, and don’t deviate from that vision. Have confidence in your own writing and storytelling abilities. Don’t accept mediocrity, and always strive to be the best at whatever you do. Be proactive and not reactive, and lead from the front.</p>
<p>Q: You have an interesting thing called the “Character Progression System” on the Galileo, which sort of reminds me of D&amp;D. How does this work, and what are the advantages of it?</p>
<p>A: Yes, we do! The Character Progression System (CPS) is an alternate and optional way to express your character if you choose to use it. The CPS presents a character in a more traditional ‘character-sheet’ method for those who feel more comfortable with table-top roleplay systems. It relies on a skill and attribute system that is based on a character’s rank, and it is balanced to allow higher-ranked and experienced characters to have more skills and perks than lower-ranked ones. The idea behind the CPS is to offer a complimentary way to express your character in addition to the written bio element. This system does not replace the traditional written bio method of simming – it is simply an extra way to show who your character is and what they excel at from a character-sheet point of view.</p>
<p>Q: In a previous issue of the Pulse, I wrote about simm ratings. Unlike the Portland, the Galileo is an 18+ simm, which allows for more mature content. Can you tell us a little about your experiences with your 18+ rating and its pros and cons?</p>
<p>A: Good question. We’ve had great success with out 18+ rating over the years. The inspiration behind our 18+ content is the film Prometheus, which has a tiny starship the size of Galileo that lands on an alien world and is subject to all types of horrific creatures. We wanted to portray scientific investigation in its entirety, not just the tranquil discoveries. We wanted to be able to show the danger, horror, and terror that sometimes occurs when a ship is exploring the unknown and is isolated from the rest of the fleet. Exploration is dangerous despite the utopian view that the Trek franchise portrays.</p>
<p>Q: Your medical department is the best in the fleet, except maybe for the Portland’s. What is your secret to having such an awesome and interesting medical department?</p>
<p>Interviewer’s note: Rear Admiral Saalm was unable to answer this question due to a sudden onslaught of the Tyrellian measles. She has been whisked to sickbay, where she will be taken care of in the hands of consummate professionals. Dr. Mott is already polishing his speculum, while Dr. Voutilainen is sharpening her bone saw and checking to ensure the restraints on the biobeds are fully functional.</p>
<p>Thank you for your answers! If anyone is interested in creating a second character, I’d urge you to check out the USS Galileo. And, Rear Admiral Saalm, consider you and your ship better known!</p>
