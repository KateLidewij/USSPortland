<p><b>Task Force formed at Starbase 375</b></br><i>Clark Kent</i></p>
<img src="images/clark.jpg">
<p>A large task force has been formed at Starbase 375, consisting of Starfleet, Klingon Defense Force, and Cardassian Defense Service vessels. While formally allies, co-operation between these three powers on such a large scale is rare.</p>
<p>Starfleet command is being tight-lipped about the nature of the task force, however many analysts believe it has something to with the destruction of the Nova Europa colony. In addition, a number of witnesses report seeing large groups of Klingons at various establishments on the starbase, boasting about the “glorious battle to come.”</p>
<p>As of press time, Admiral Washington did not return our requests for comment.</p>

<p><b>AI Sumposium Announced</b></br><i>Rostrenen T'Sering</i></p>
<img src="images/rostrenen.jpg">
<p>The 23rd Annual Federation Artificial Intelligence Symposium was announced today. Hosted by the Daystrom Institute, this year’s symposium will be held on the planet Trill and will feature some of the brightest minds in the quadrant.</p>
<p>Expected topics of discussion will include prototype shipboard AIs, the Borg hive mind, and the ethics of sentient artificial intelligences. The ruling council of Trill has issued a statement welcoming the choice of venue, and encouraging attendees to visit the beautiful mountains and lush green forests of Trill.</p>

<p><b>Chief Morale Officer’s Report</b></br><i>Acting Ensign Ko-ko</i></p>
<img src="images/koko.jpg">
<p>Congratulations, everyone! November 2015 marks a new record post count and the Portland’s first triple-digit month!
<p>We also welcomed the newest member of the Portland crew, Ensign Malbi tai-Konjah, a Klingon Computer Systems Specialist. I’m sure we’ll have plenty for her to do, between our tinkering with sentient holograms and our plans to disrupt the Borg hive mind./p>
<p>Missions Four and Five are finally closed, and we’re now focusing on Mission Six, the second part of our Borg joint mission with the Endeavour. After this, the tentative plan is to do a “shore leave” type mission for Mission Seven, and then bring back Vike, a recurring villain from Mission One, for a mission tentatively titled “Cold Case.”/p>
<p>Finally, we did a round of awards, so check out the News and Announcements subforum to see who was awarded in November. For some of the new players this might be your first round of awards, but we try to do them every few months to recognize each other’s contributions, and you can at any time nominate another player for an award./p>
<p>Once more, thank you all for your participation in the Portland. Our success is thanks to our wonderful players./p>
<p>Oh, and a little birdie told me that a future Star Trek fan may arrive within the next few weeks…</p>

<p><b>A Fistful of Zades</b></br><i>Oahu Zade</i></p>
<img src="images/oahu.jpg"></br>
<b>USS Aion, 2861</b>
<p>[Good morning, it is time reference zero seven hundred, on day two seventy three in Federation Year seven aught aught. Your bedsheet will now be deconstituted.]</p>
<p>The chilly morning air swept in at the sudden absence of her bedsheet, sweeping over bare skin. It had been the sym’s idea, it had programmed Trill breezes into her quarters when she wasn’t looking. She had tried to explain how she was half-human and a half of that was Hawaiian and very not used to the cold mountain air of Trill the first seven times she erased that damn programming. The sym was annoyingly persistent.</p>
<p>Brushing a mess of long dark brown curls from her eyes she rose and stretched, shivering. Goosebumps and chittering teeth were her usual companions with the Trill morning program. She could smell the frost from the high moors, the liidell and fernmoss and a bitter snap of the collingrove trees. The aroma’s were subtle and perfect, spurring happy memories of a place shed never seen on a planet she’d never even visited.</p>
<p>“You went to college there, girl.” The man behind her spoke. She looked over her bare shoulder crossly at the smug man. He was as tall and arrogant looking as ever with a long hook nose wearing an absurdly complicated topcoat and vest ensemble that had the kind of particular style that cried out ‘from the dawn of time’.</p>
<p>“I’m not even dressed yet.” She glowered and stood walking to the general area of the bedroom that she preferred to take her showers. She had gotten used to him puttering about her peripheral vision at inopportune moments but it was still disconcerting to have a grown man towering over her before she was dressed. “And I took holocourses, I wasn’t actually there, just sort of holo-actually there.” She felt the stirring vibrations along her bare skin, she opened her mouth and closed her eyes as the invisible brushes of silence and air swept over and around her. The sonic shower cleaned quickly and the atmospherics followed with a hint of lilac across her body and mint to sweep away the taste of sleep. Then it was time for general admonishments.</p>
<p>“Sym, I thought we agreed to delete the Trill breezes?” She began in a smooth but firm voice with a practiced hint of schoolmarm crossness.</p>
<p>“It’s the only program that actually wakes you up.” The man stood in front of her and looked her over. “It is important to obey the directives of time travel,…”</p>
<p>He began droning on about the rules and regulations, she remembered about how keen he had been to learn them. Something about how his favorite little Tyrlai had purposely learned them wrong had spurred him to memorize them so he could bore her to death at every opportunity.</p>
<p>“,…. When approached by a native of the sub 25th century era it is critically important to,…. “</p>
<p>She had grown tired of the short hair, it had been days now. She grabbed her brush and lengthened it, long and straight, a smokey dark brown to match her eyes before she’d had them augmented. After a good many seconds a long thick mane of it rolled over her shoulders tapering at the middle of her back. She was promptly clad in a silver duty uniform circa 2144, miniskirted, black boots dark hose with a visual filter hiding the leopard spotting along her legs. She brushed back her hair and tapped the cosmetic display adding long artificial lashes and a muted red gloss to her lips. She also locked her eyes back at their original dark liquid brown. A clip to hold back her hair and she was presentable.</p>
<p>“,… is of the utmost importance less the timestream be corrupted. Now, girl, repeat that back to me.”</p>
<p>“Blah, blah, blah, Im a boring stuffy ancient worm, blah blah, I know everything, blah blah blah.”</p>
<p>Oahu was slight, almost nine inches under average height for the 29th. She was lean and wiry due to the insane syms crazy fitness program. She ran the decks of the ship every morning she wasn’t on mission and half the evenings. It did tend to help when she angered the temporal natives which tended to happen rather more often than she let on in her reports. Her head was a little large for her frame and far too full of thoughts according to her mother. Her eyes were wide and expressive, and tended to dart back and forth looking at everything and then some, a smooth but sharp jaw framed full wide lips and a delicate little nose that gave her a fresh and disarmingly common look.</p>
<p>As a field agent it was designed to give her ‘an attractive and approachable demeanor, decidedly non-threatening and eliciting of empathy from hominids especially of the male variance’.   Her field trainer’s only advice had been ‘not to talk so very very much’ and ‘don’t be so pretty’ and ‘something important about recursive incursion’, oh, and ‘why do you sound british? Well stop it’. There was also something about empathizing too much but all of that had been 1400 years ago or somesuch. Before Zade was often fuzzy.</p>
<p>“You have far too many internal delusions about time travel, my dear.”</p>
<p>She looked over at Sym, glowering. “Says my internal delusion.” She gasped as a sharp pain radiated through her side making her half-double over.</p>
<p>“What is that?” Sym said with alarm, walking over to her.</p>
<p>“Sym, we agreed when I’m dressing you stay against the wall.”</p>
<p>“I have seen everything before.”</p>
<p>“And loved every minute of it you dirty little,… gahhhhh.” She stepped gingerly over to her table and grabbed a palm scanner. Running it over her abdomen the readout displayed on a sextet of holographic panels floating around her.</p>
<p>Sym and Oahu stared back and forth at the data for several long sentences, eventually coming to the same vocalization of their collective conclusion at the exact same time. “Weird.”</p>
<p>“My trocidic numbers are very good, you must have been adhering to the protein regimen.” Sym smiled, clearly glad he was having an effect on the young lady.</p>
<p>“You know damn well I have been cheating constantly.” She looked over each of the displays a second time. “Well we aren’t going to drop dead today. We can have it checked tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Very well, but I want to know if you have any more episodes, young lady.”</p>
<p>The screens, almost as if on cue, lit up with pinpoints of fuzzy white and alarming blips. They both stared at them blinking, the impossible little lights continued to pop into view. “H-How is that even possible, this is a medical scan?”</p>
<b>Trill, 2113</b>
<p>“Mum, hes making faces at me again!”</p>
<p>Erigalis Zade leaned over forward, the sudden stabbing pain in his side overwhelming him for a moment. He gasped hard and winced drawing a sharp breath passed clenched teeth as he slowly tried to will himself back to a sitting position.</p>
<p>“Stop making faces at your daughter!” The piercing voice of his wife was just slightly less painful than the shivering lancing in the side of his abdomen.</p>
<p>“I-I, go to your room.” He winced at little Colquia.</p>
<p>“I don’t have to, Mom says.”</p>
<p>She stuck her tongue out at him and his blood raged, the insufferable woman was undermining him again. He straightened shedding the pain momentarily and glared at the girl. “What did you just say?”</p>
<b>USS Hood, 2267</b>
<p>Cedria Zade leaned back as the klingon’s blade whistled just overhead. She arched and flipped back into a cartwheel as the second Klingon tried to run her through. A spin kick to his backside sent him sprawling and she readied her sword for the orgonal advancing warrior. Suddenly she felt a stabbing pain in her side and turned expecting to see a third Klingon with a sword buried into her back. But there was nothing there, except almost blinding pain.</p>
<p>“What gambit is this, Zade?” The Klingon held his place expecting some form of Trill treachery was afoot.</p>
<p>“I-I, keep your distance, Kleeg, if you know what is good for you.” Cedria squeaked as menacingly as she could. Her face flushed and her breathing and heart rate leapt. Her back leg almost gave way, her balance wavering visibly.</p>
<p>The Klingon took a step back, his friend rising from the floor behind him. Both risked looks at each other uncertainly and stared warily at the blonde Trill woman in starfleet gold.</p>
<p>After a few moments the Klingon put up his blade and stepped back. “I will not be tricked, stand and fight properly.”</p>
<p>Cedria took a few stablizing breaths and smirked glaring up at them with brightening jade eyes. They had had her, if only they had known.</p>
<b>Trill, 2052</b>
<p>The last light danced its way over the sparkling wavelets on the otherwise calm bay. The sun was low and fading quickly and the autumn was quietly taking hold of the countryside. It was almost contemplatively idyllic and he liked to think the murdered girl would have enjoyed the view.</p>
<p>Sidar Zade looked back over his shoulder at the scene, and gasped himself. Not at the violence that had transpired som hour and a half ago, but at the blossoming pain. Something in his side. He grabbed a railing and leaned over slightly as if he was examining the scene.</p>
<b>Trill, 2137</b>
<p>“And yet as often these energies will erode containment of this fashion. It is therefore,…” Kyrania clutched her side and paused, eyes closing against the sharp pain. There was a murmur through the auditorium as the speaker visibally paled and stood motionless for several long moments. An aide walked over to her and whispered, she was too busy trying to hold on to the podiam to hear what he said. When she could breathe again she excused herself and left.</p>
<b>USS Portland, 2392</b>
<p>Tyrlai strode through the corridor looking over a copy of her report to the Temporal Affairs commission or whomever wanted her to write up the details on the Captains ressurection. It had been a farsical experience. Since whatever potential future had been a closed loop she really had no idea what it would have been. All she saw for sure is that she wasn’t there.</p>
<p>She should have been there. Whatever it was that came to pass in that alternate future, she hadn’t been there.
<p>She knew the plan, unite the shards so the orb could do its job. There was nothing that would have stopped her from seeing that through. And it had been seen through, by Tim. And some other people.</p>
<p>But not her. The one thing she wouldn’t have missed. Most of her report was speculation. She knew the general plan, she had hatched it with the Wormhole Aliens but as to how it all happened. A strange mystery and she was left to wonder what ultimately led her to fail it, and hand it off to Tim.</p>
<p>She stumbled into the wall, clutching the stabbing pain in her side. Her eyes widened and she gasped in pain. The shard was gone, it was gone and yet,…</p>
<p>Tyrlai Zade stood leaning against the wall until she could move again. She was starting to get the feeling she knew what had stopped her.</p>
