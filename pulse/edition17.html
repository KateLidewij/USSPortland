<section><h1>Portland Pulse - Edition 17 (Oktober 6, 2392)</h1>
<p><b>USS Comit to be launched in 2404</b></br><i>Kaspar van Oranje</i></p>
<img src="images/kaspar.jpg">
<p>This is Kaspar van Oranje of the Federation News Service, reporting to you live from the 25th Century. Or whatever you’d call it when I’m actually twelve years ahead. The Federation Department of Temporal Investigations is kindly allowing us this brief connection to tell you about an exciting moment in history, so long as I don’t give away too much and risk a disruption in the space-time continuum. Let’s get started; as they say in the Temporal Mechanics Department: there’s no time like the present.</p>
<p>Starfleet is launching the most daring and ambitious mission of exploration to date. The USS Comet, first of her class, is a next generation exploration cruiser that will be travelling to the furthest regions of the Alpha Quadrant on a twelve year deep space assignment. Now, twelve years is a long time, but this ship is equipped with the latest technologies that will support its efforts such as the < REDACTED > and the < REDACTED >. Not to mention < REDACTED >.</p>
<p>All this amazing technology is only as good as the crew that uses it of course. Captain Llywelyn Faraday is in command, the youngest captain in Starfleet history. His first officer, Commander Hachirou Takeshi, is a no-nonsense fellow who I know will be driving this crew hard. Lieutenant Niveren Elbrun for Security might have a tainted record but she’s proven herself once again to be a fine officer. Lieutenant Commander Wren Crawford for Engineering has a knack for putting together a warp coil from discarded plasma conduits, self-sealing stem bolts, and a toothbrush. Lieutenant Ahm Kommel will head up the Science Department, a man looking for his own answers even as he answers questions about the universe. Doctor Ragnar Sigur is the Chief Medical Officer, a former soldier turned healer, one of the most disciplined men you’ll ever meet.</p>
<p>Starfleet Command is confident that the crew will deal with the recent < REDACTED > and launch the vessel soon to inspire billions. We need that symbol this ship will represent, and we need it bad. War looms on the horizon once again, the Federation is threatened from nearly all sides, and citizens are nervous about what the next few years will bring. Starfleet believes that by having this amazing ship focused on it’s ideals of peaceful exploration, bravely daring the unknown, will bring hope back to the Federation. If you ever find your way through a temporal wormhole, make sure you stop by Utopia Planitia to see the Comet before she leaves us for a long, long time.</p>
That’s it for now, folks. This is Kaspar van Oranje, on board the USS Comet, signing off. Happy Trails.</p>

<p><b>USS Deimos Relaunced</b></br><i>Clark Kent</i></p>
<img src="images/clark.jpg">
<p>The USS Deimos is the latest vessel to be relaunched as part of the Steamrunner class refit program. Under the command of Commander Raktael Kelarna and Lieutenant Anatrie Kheim, the Deimos is set to embark on a shakedown cruise before commencing with her duties.</p>
<p>Named after the Greek god of terror, the Deimos will surely strike fear into the hearts of those who wish harm to the Federation.</p>

<p><b>Chief Morale Officer’s Report</b></br><i>Acting Ensign Ko-ko</i></p>
<img src="images/koko.jpg">
<p>Wow! We had an awesome month in September, with a whopping 94 posts! That’s a new simm record! A big shout-out goes to everyone who made this possible with your activity!</p>
<p>Our latest round of new recruits, Ronald and Kahnr, have been settling in quite nicely, and have been actively getting involved with the story. Kahnr’s shuttles in particular have played a big role in the Borg mission, being used to sneak into a Borg unicomplex to get a closer look at what’s going on. I think this month really shows the power of incorporating and saying yes to player ideas. We’ve added a lot of cool scenes and interesting ideas to missions four and five, which are all thanks to you, the players.</p>
<p>Our goal for October is going to be to wrap up the two missions we have on the go, and begin the joint mission with the Endeavour! This is something that’s been in the works for a long time, and I’m excited to get going!</p>
<p>And, Marcus even has a date!</p>

<p><b>Captain's Corner: Why I love the Miranda Class</b></br><i>Captain Alenis Meru</i></p>
<img src="images/alenis.jpg">	
<p>A couple months ago, I wrote a little article for the Pulse about ship classes. I thought I would follow that up here with a little explanation about why I chose the Miranda. It may have been an odd choice – a Miranda class in 2391 – but when I chose it, it was the only one of its kind in the fleet and the Portland had been amazingly successful so far.</p>
<p>First, there is no small number of reasons which at first glance might be superficial, but which I think add up to a little more personal connection to the ship. I came into Star Trek via the original series and the original six movies, so I have a certain appreciation for the older ships and how they connect the prime OF-verse to the Star Trek I have the most nostalgia for. Not to mention that The Wrath of Khan is one of my favourite movies, and I love the classic lines of the TOS/movie era ships. An archaic bucket of bolts like the Portland has a certain character, which in my opinion, is lacking in a lot of the newer ships.</p>
<p>Second, I had some idea what I wanted. I didn’t want a gigantic ship that could overpower anything in the quadrant, so the Elysium-class was out. My vision for Star Trek is one of a Starfleet which is primarily meant for peaceful exploration and humanitarian initiatives, and a very combat-oriented vessel like a Defiant or a Prometheus wouldn’t really fit in well with my vision and the kinds of missions I wanted to run. I wanted to do a variety of missions, so I didn’t want something that was too specialized such as a Nova or an Olympic class. As such, a light, multi-role cruiser, was ideal.</p>
<p>I also had a vision that the old girl would be used as a testbed for new and experimental technologies, such as Project Mongoose and the Dark Energy Reactor. Not only does this help keep the engineering crew involved, but it also gives us the opportunity to really indulge in the technobabble and try out some unique systems. As an old design, one which was so reliable that it has been kept in service for over a century, the Miranda class is an ideal testbed for new technologies.</p>
<p>Finally, I think more important than the strengths of a ship are it’s weaknesses, because the weaknesses are a source of drama. And as a hundred year old ship, the Portland has a lot. It’s not the biggest, or the fastest, or the most powerful ship. But when we’re outrun and outgunned, that’s when the creative juices really get flowing.</p>
<p><b>To close with a quote from Captain Jean-Luc Picard,</b></p>
<p><i>The first ship I ever served aboard as Captain was called the Stargazer… it was an overworked, underpowered vessel that was always on the verge of flying apart at the seams. In every measurable way, my Enterprise is a superior ship. And yet… there are times I miss that cramped little Bridge very much.</i></p>

<p><b>Quotes of the Month</b></p>
<p>“Father has gone missing… They sent officers to tell me. He was in the Gamma quadrant examining flora when they lost contact with his team. So I packed my stuff and came here to get you so we can go look for him.” She looked up at that last part, pausing to wipe her eyes of the few tears she couldn’t stop, her eyes puffy but hopeful as she waited for her sisters confirmation of her plan.</br>“I… why did he leave? He’s never been off Earth…The Portland is stuck in dry dock, ordered by Starfleet… maybe we can get a shuttle… Selina, come with me to the Portland. We’ll figure something out.”</br>–<i>Sera and Selina Williams</i></p>
<p>“Your father is the only Vulcan I know that likes spicy food,” Marcus commented as he sat, placing his half-drank glass of water above his place setting. “And yes, I know you’re not fully Vulcan. I just find it funny.”</br>“And you my friend are the most Vulcan-like human I’ve ever met.”</br>–<i>Marcus Kallan and Jason Beauvoir</i></p>
<p>“She touched the shard, so many years ago… She’s been aging in reverse; getting weaker and weaker. She doesn’t have much time left. The orb… it’s our only hope.”</br>–<i>Timothy Rouse, referring to Tyrlai Zade</i></p>
<p>”Captain Williams, you have the conn. I need you to make a distraction; hold off the Eclipse as long as you can.” Timothy looked around the bridge. “Meru, Tolaran, Zirra… we’re going in.”</br>–<i>Timothy Rouse</i></p>
<p>“THAT is a very good question. What makes an A.I.? Perhaps what we should be asking ourselves instead is what makes a person. We were all in the middle of figuring out what we had created, and then the captain died. I can’t help but think we might had afterwards convinced ourselves that the captain is living on in this program. At least I know I have that concern.”</br>–<i>Brad Silverton</i></p>
<p>“Will there be other wildlife I’ll get to meet, Captain?”</br>“Just little Novia’s cat-monkeys. Speaking of which, if you ever have to go into the Jeffries tubes, make sure you close the access port behind you. About two months ago someone forgot, and we had to send a security team in to extract Zinzac and Berelca.”</br>–<i>Kahnr Dai and Alenis Meru</i></p>
<p>“You have new orders. Your dark energy systems may be getting a more robust trial than planned.”</br>
“Oh? I can’t wait to inform Shras. Where are we off to now?”</br>“Nebula NGC-3814. At 1800 hours yesterday, the USS Endeavour responded to a distress call from the Nova Europa colony. Upon arrival, they engaged the Borg.”</br>–<i>Admiral Washington and Alenis Meru</i></p>
<p>“Starleet is sending the very oldest and smallest ship in the fleet into a Nebula full of Borg?” Oddly enough facing deadly and insane odds was not her first thought, it was how many Gaskets Thosk would lose when he found out about this. “If we were the fastest ship that might be something, why would we even be considered for such a,…” She trailed off remembering who’s office she and Jena had just filled with translucent lubricating foam. “The Commodore brought something clever and untested along with him again, is that it? I didn’t bring you back from the dead so you could just rush headlong back towards it!!”</br>“The prophets brought me back.” She reminded the Trill.</br>“Technically.” Tyrlai scowled, brightening only slightly as she remembered.</br>–<i>Tyrlai Zade and Alenis Meru</i></p>
<p>“I’m not going to remove you from command. You’re too good of a captain; too good of a tactician. But as soon as this mission is over, I want you to go see Dr. Carlisle. And I’m going to confiscate every drop of wine in your quarters. And the bottle of Romulan Ale hidden in that sculpture of yours.”</br>–<i>Timothy Rouse</i></p>
<p>“Oh, I have one more request,” said the hologram, blushing sheepishly as she stopped Marcus from leaving. There was no delicate way to put this. “I don’t really have a place right now, and I’ve been discussing this with Lieutenant Beauvoir… if you don’t get assimilated, would you mind installing some holo-emitters in his quarters for me?”</br>A slow smile spread across Marcus’ face. “Oh, but of course. Anything for Beauvy.”</br>–<i>Holo-Meru and Marcus</i></p>
<p>“Meru, Jason stop ‘making eyes’ at each other. It’s obvious you like each other, why don’t you just tell each other how you feel and then you can progress from there?”</br>"Ummmm… Jason, you go first.”</br>–<i>Jena and Holo-Meru</i></p>
<p>“These things are going to fly like bricks,”</br>–<i>Jackson Mallory</i></p>
<p>“On the Eve of battle, still sticking to your protein cubes?”</br>–<i>Sera Williams, to Marcus Kallan</i></p>
<p>“Omigod, this is so awesome!… But… our warp core is pretty cool too,”</br>–<i>Nikki Barclay, on the Dark Energy Reactor</i></p>
