<p><b>USS Portland wins Unit of Merit Award</b></br><i>Clark Kent</i></p>
<img src="images/clark.jpg">
<p>The USS Portland, flagship of Obsidian Fleet’s Task Group 72A, has been awarded the Silver Unit of Merit award for June. With a high post count, a lot of quality posts, and some significant story advancement, the Portland is very much deserving of this award.</p>
<p>This is the third Silver Unit of Merit award for the USS Portland, which, in addition to their last award, a Bronze Unit of Merit award, brings the Portland’s medal count up to four. Sources indicate that the crew of the Portland are excited about their accomplishment, and aim to add a Gold Unit of Merit award to their roster.</p>

<p><b>USS Inuit Refits Nearly Complete</b></br><i>Jake Sisko</i></p>
<img src="images/jake.jpg">
<p>The USS Inuit, a Cheyenne class starship, is nearly completing a series of refits intended to outfit her with advanced 2390s technology. First launched in the 2360s, the Cheyenne is a light cruiser with an extremely high power output for its size, a product of its unique quad-nacelle design.</p>
<p>“I expect the Inuit to fill a hole within Task Group 72A,” said Admiral James Washington, in a holo-interview from his office on Deep Space Nine. “The Task Group needs a good, solid, powerful light cruiser.”</p>
<p>When reminded that the USS Portland is also a light cruiser in the task group, the admiral simply chuckled and changed the subject. According to sources within Starfleet Command, a search for the right CO and crew for the ship is under way.</p></section>

<p><b>Chief Morale Officer’s Report</b></br><i>Acting Ensign Ko-ko</i></p>
<img src="images/koko.jpg">
<p>This issue of the Pulse is a little late, and for that I blame the indolence of our captain. Still, as Chief Morale Officer, I have a number of exciting things to report.</p>
<p>First, we won the Silver Unit of Merit award for June! We had a great month back in June, and it’s wonderful to be recognized for that. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Unit of Merit awards system, every month, Bronze Unit of Merit awards are given to the ship which has excelled the most in the task group, Silver to the one which has excelled the most in the task force, and Gold for the best in the fleet. This is the third Silver Unit of Merit award for the Portland in less than a year and a half, which I think really says something about the quality of the simm.</p>
<p>Second, the month of July was a good one. We had two new players join, but one of them ran into personal issues and had to quit right away. However, we are still happy to have Ensign Kahnr Dai aboard the USS Portland as our new Chief Flight Control Officer. This is a position we’ve been trying to fill for a long time, and finally rounds out our department heads. In addition, we had 54 posts in July, which is a good number.</p>
<p>As for our current situation, the command staff is going to be pushing forward with the plot in both of our missions. We’d like to try to wrap up Mission Four, as well as push forward on Mission Five so we can complete that and get to our joint mission with the Endeavour. In particular, we’re looking to wrap up our battle with the Eclipse in Mission Four, as well as the briefing and anything else in Mission Five which occurs before we get into the action.</p>

<p><b>Captain's Corner: The ship makes the simm?</b></br><i>Captain Alenis Meru</i></p>
<img src="images/alenis.jpg">	
<p>As the Task Group Commanding Officer of TG72A, one of the more interesting duties I have is to manage the open commands. As a task group in Obsidian Fleet has six ships, whenever we have fewer than six for whatever reason, the remainder are what are called open commands – placeholder ships waiting for COs to apply for them. While in some sense it does seem odd to be building what are essentially Potemkin villages waiting for inhabitants, I must admit that throwing up a name, class, and picture can help get the creative juices flowing and can be a good recruiting tool (right, Eilis?).</p>
<p>Choosing a ship and a class is something that has to be done carefully, whether you’re a TGCO trying to fill an open position, or a player making the jump to the center chair. A lot of considerations go into picking out just the right ship, and while sometimes it can be love at first sight, as it was when I was offered a Miranda, often it’s not a decision that can be made willy-nilly. Simply picking out a ship that looks cool can create headaches down the road later.</p>
<p><b>Ship or station?</b></p>
<p>One of the first considerations is whether to go for a ship at all, or to consider something like a station or a marine base. While I’ve never served on a station as a crew member, my first attempt at command was a station. It was an independent simm known as Star Trek: Unity, created out of the ruins of an OF simm which crashed and burned. Unfortunately, it fell victim to inactivity and my busy schedule at the time, but we had an interesting concept. All right, it was kind of a ripoff of DS9, and my CO character, one Alenis Meru, was kind of a ripoff of both Kira Nerys and Benjamin Sisko, but at least I salvaged something out of it.</p>
<p>A station can be a very interesting setting – with more people coming and going, and the challenge of not being able to go to warp 9 and get out of there when you’re in trouble. But, it can also require a little more work on the concept up front. Where is the station located? Why did Starfleet (or someone else?) build a station there? Who are the neighbours? You may even have to figure out your potential missions from the start, as it can be tricky to do a Cardassian mission when you’ve placed your station on the Klingon border.</p>
<p><b>Or perhaps an alien ship?</b></p>
<p>Alien ships can also be interesting. We’ve just launched one in TG72A, the IRW Kholhr, a Romulan Valdore-class warbird. The strength of an alien ship is that you instantly have a unique simm. The weakness is also that you instantly have a unique simm. Done well, alien ships can be very interesting and unique, and attract players who are interested in something different. However, it also requires a command staff who is intimately familiar with whichever alien culture is running the ship, and while you can effectively corner the market for players who want to simm on an alien ship, it can also be a bit of a niche market. Commanding an alien simm can be a challenge, but also a rewarding one.</p>
<p><b>What do you want your ship to do?</b></p>
<p>But regardless of whether you go for a ship or a station, or a Starfleet or alien ship, you’re going to need to think about a ship’s capabilities and its strengths and weaknesses, and make sure that is what you want. What do you want your ship to be able to do? What do you want it to struggle with? What sort of missions would you like to run? Do you want a very specialized ship, a jack of all trades, or maybe even a civilian or alien vessel? It would be hard to do a lot of science focused missions in a Prometheus class, or fight off the Borg in an Olympic, so making sure the class fits the theme of your simm is a good idea.</p>
<p><b>And how will you attract players?</b></p>
<p>Of course, a simm is only as good as its players, and it’s probably a good idea to consider whether your concept will attract players or get lost in the crowd of the hundreds of simms on the internet. Picking out your ship is in some way a way to distinguish yourself from the crowd, as it can be a part of your simm’s unique concept.</p>
<p>One thing to consider is that a lot of people tend to gravitate towards ships of classes that they are familiar with, especially those which had featured in the shows. Not to mention that running a ship that was featured in the shows can be a lot easier on the CO. It’s easy to find good pictures for iconic ships such as the Galaxy class, or pretty much any ship which has been featured in Star Trek Online, but there are some non-canon classes out there which are hard to find images and information on (Anubis class, I’m looking in your direction…).</p>
<p>That said, a good simm should be able to sell itself on more than just the class of ship, and the great diversity of players out there means that there will always be people interested in a shiny new Prometheus class bristling with weapons and multi-vector assault mode, an oddball Olympic class, or an archaic bucket of bolts like the Portland.</p>
<p><b>TGCO considerations</b></p>
<p>Finally, as TGCO, I have a few considerations as well. When I’m creating open commands, I want to make sure I’m picking out ship classes that attract good COs and can be made into successful simms. I also like to keep a little bit of balance in the task group, in case we end up doing joint missions, we have ships with different roles and capabilities which can complement each other.</p>
<p><b>Final thoughts</b></p>
<p>Choosing the proper ship class is one of the most important decisions that a new CO can make. Because with the difficulty of changing ships, once they make that choice, the CO is pretty much stuck with it. Don’t just pick out a class because you think it looks cool – though, looking cool helps!</p>

<p>“I hope you’re happy with yourself! I tried to initialize the EMH and the computer said that her program wasn’t found! What, did you delete her? Murder her in cold blood? And you have the gall to show yourself in our mess hall? I hope you like your protein cube, holo-murderer.”</br>“Heh, I knew that would happen. Relax, Ensign, the program got renamed. It is 100% intact. In fact, you might find that there’s additional hardware installed in Holodeck One that’s making its program considerably more stable.”</br>“Oh.”</br>-<i>Nikki Barclay and Marcus Kallan</i></p>
<p>“Fine, but next time, give me some advance warning before you set me up with someone, okay?”</br>-<i>Judith Rouse</i></p>

<p>“Lieutenant Beauvoir is handsome, sensitive, and kind. I suppose if circumstances were different, a romantic relationship might be possible. Is that all?”</br>-<i>Holo-Meru</i></p>
<p>“Starfleet was founded on the ideals of exploration, on seeking out new and alien forms of life, and on advancing our knowledge of the universe. Perhaps these are lofty, high-minded goals, but they are what we have committed ourselves to when we joined. And sometimes, what we are to explore is not out there beyond the stars, but right here in front of us… Which is why I’m assigning you to the USS Portland…”</br>“Wait, what? This is a joke, right?
