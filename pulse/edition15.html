<p><b>USS Portland wins Unit of Merit Award</b></br><i>Clark Kent</i></p>
<img src="images/clark.jpg">
The USS Portland, flagship of Obsidian Fleet’s Task Group 72A, has been awarded the Silver Unit of Merit award for June. With a high post count, a lot of quality posts, and some significant story advancement, the Portland is very much deserving of this award.
This is the third Silver Unit of Merit award for the USS Portland, which, in addition to their last award, a Bronze Unit of Merit award, brings the Portland’s medal count up to four. Sources indicate that the crew of the Portland are excited about their accomplishment, and aim to add a Gold Unit of Merit award to their roster.

<p><b>USS Inuit Refits Nearly Complete</b></br><i>Jake Sisko</i></p>
<img src="images/jake.jpg">
The USS Inuit, a Cheyenne class starship, is nearly completing a series of refits intended to outfit her with advanced 2390s technology. First launched in the 2360s, the Cheyenne is a light cruiser with an extremely high power output for its size, a product of its unique quad-nacelle design.
“I expect the Inuit to fill a hole within Task Group 72A,” said Admiral James Washington, in a holo-interview from his office on Deep Space Nine. “The Task Group needs a good, solid, powerful light cruiser.”
When reminded that the USS Portland is also a light cruiser in the task group, the admiral simply chuckled and changed the subject. According to sources within Starfleet Command, a search for the right CO and crew for the ship is under way.

<p><b>Chief Morale Officer’s Report</b></br><i>Acting Ensign Ko-ko</i></p>
<img src="images/koko.jpg">
This issue of the Pulse is a little late, and for that I blame the indolence of our captain. Still, as Chief Morale Officer, I have a number of exciting things to report.
First, we won the Silver Unit of Merit award for June! We had a great month back in June, and it’s wonderful to be recognized for that. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Unit of Merit awards system, every month, Bronze Unit of Merit awards are given to the ship which has excelled the most in the task group, Silver to the one which has excelled the most in the task force, and Gold for the best in the fleet. This is the third Silver Unit of Merit award for the Portland in less than a year and a half, which I think really says something about the quality of the simm.
Second, the month of July was a good one. We had two new players join, but one of them ran into personal issues and had to quit right away. However, we are still happy to have Ensign Kahnr Dai aboard the USS Portland as our new Chief Flight Control Officer. This is a position we’ve been trying to fill for a long time, and finally rounds out our department heads. In addition, we had 54 posts in July, which is a good number.
As for our current situation, the command staff is going to be pushing forward with the plot in both of our missions. We’d like to try to wrap up Mission Four, as well as push forward on Mission Five so we can complete that and get to our joint mission with the Endeavour. In particular, we’re looking to wrap up our battle with the Eclipse in Mission Four, as well as the briefing and anything else in Mission Five which occurs before we get into the action.
