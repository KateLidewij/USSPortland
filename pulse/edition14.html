<p><b>USS Nightingale wins Gold Unit of Merit Award</b></br><i>Clark Kent</i></p>
<img src="images/clark.jpg">
<p>The Olympic class USS Nightingale, captained by Commander Pola Ni Dhuinn, is the recipient of the prestigious Obsidian Fleet Gold Unit of Merit award for May 2015. The Nightingale is a freshly refitted hospital ship, about to embark upon its first mission.</p>
<p>“I’m very proud of the Nightingale and her crew,” remarked Captain Alenis Meru, the Nightingale’s Task Group Commanding Officer, “they’re setting a great example for the fleet.”</p>
<p>Both Captain Alenis and Rear Admiral James Hurin are currently en route to the Nightingale as guests of Commander Ni Dhuinn for her maiden voyage.</p>

<p><b>Chief Morale Officer’s Report</b></br><i>Acting Ensign Ko-ko</i></p>
<img src="images/koko.jpg">
<p>The Portland had a great month, with 79 posts, largely due to a big multi-part JP that we’ve been working on for a while finally getting posted. This is a significant improvement in the raw numbers from the 30-40 posts that we’ve been having over the past few months.</p>
<p>We did welcome one new player aboard, but before he could get started, he ran into personal issues and had to resign. The command staff had come up with a special position as a dark energy specialist for him, however that role is going to be taken by a guest star that some of you may remember from episode one.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve officially started Mission Five. This is the first of a two-part mission, where the second part will be a joint mission with our sister ship, the USS Endeavour, so we’ve decided to launch the mission early to get a head start so we can synchronize with the Endeavour for the second part. The Portland, outfitted with some new prototype dark energy technology, is going to be sent to investigate Borg presence inside a nebula.</p>
<p>A quick note on continuity: we are currently in the middle of Mission Four, which involves our characters in both the present (2391) and the future (2412). Our characters’ future selves will (hopefully) save the real Meru and send her back in time to 2391, thus making this an alternate future. Mission Five will take place in 2392, after Mission Four and several months of shore leaves and uneventful duty.
<p>Also, watch out for Biff Tannen.</p>

<p><b>Dark Energy Project Report</b></br><i>Commander Shras</i></p>
<img src="images/shras.jpg">
<p>Well, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that the head of Starfleet R&amp;D has finally authorized the installation of a prototype dark energy reactor and associated systems into a ship. The bad news is that it’s the USS Portland.</p>
<p>I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve this or who in the admiralty I’ve pissed off, but I’ve already lodged several dozen letters of complaint at being assigned to such a sub-par ship. I’ve heard that they have gotten some new crew since my last visit, which I suppose is a good thing; they can’t possibly be any worse than the crew from the last time I had the displeasure of conducting experiments on board.</p>
<p>I suppose things have not been so bad this time; I’ve at least been given some office space where I can work in peace for now, however the Chief Science Officer is returning soon and I will end up having the indignity of sharing research space with him. I’ve sent in a letter of protest with Admiral Washington and am looking forward to hearing his response.</p>
<p>The one curious thing is that the main computer core seems to be running slightly slower than usual. I first noticed it when I was trying to do some simple hyper-dimensional calculations and it took several milliseconds longer than expected. Apparently some holo-program is using system resources. I tried to delete it but was locked out, and everyone seems tight-lipped about the nature of this program. I will have to investigate; this 0.17% loss of efficiency in the main computer is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p><b>Captain's Corner: Thoughts on simm ratings</b></br><i>Captain Alenis Meru</i></p>
<img src="images/alenis.jpg">
<p>One of the many bureaucratic aspects of Obsidian Fleet is its rating system. Similar to the content rating systems of movies or video games, it categorizes simms based on the level of sexual and violent content. In Obsidian Fleet, there are three categories, 13+, 15+, and 18+, with increasing levels of violence, sexual content, and profanity as the age range increases. Simms have a default rating of 13+, and commanding officers may apply for rating increases, which are approved or rejected by fleet operations.</p>
<p>There are many COs who apply for rating increases as soon as they can. Some do it because they want, while others do it out of desperation to breathe new life into a flagging simm (which almost never works). On the Portland, we’ve been going for over a year with our 13+ rating and have no plans to apply for an increase. From the initial launch of the Portland, I felt that the 13+ rating matched my vision of both the Star Trek universe and the direction I wanted to take the Portland. So, for the following reasons, I’ve decided not to apply for a rating increase:</p>
<p><b>1. It keeps in the feel of Star Trek</b></p>
<p>Star Trek is basically a 13+ show. There is the occasional fistfight and sometimes they do have to use their phasers, but beyond that, there isn’t really much violence or sexual content explicitly shown on screen. In fact, some of the best episodes consist solely of people standing around a room talking – think “The Measure of a Man” or “Duet.” Nothing can kill the feel of Star Trek faster than seeing characters dropping f-bombs and engaging in brutal violence. Unless maybe it’s the mirror universe…</p>
<p><b>2. “Gritty” isn’t always good</b></p>
<p>I find that one of the most overused words out there in roleplaying is “gritty,” and many players and game masters seem to take a lot of pride in their efforts to be more gritty. Yet, one of the key tenets of Star Trek is its utopian outlook on the future, where humanity has bettered itself and works to advance scientific and humanitarian causes. Going in a more “gritty” direction and getting a rating increase can work against that and tamper with some pretty fundamental ideas of Star Trek. And while there is nothing inherently wrong with taking a new approach to things, doing so requires a certain amount of careful planning and forethought.</p>
<p><b>3. 13+ isn’t that restrictive.</b></p>
<p>When you really think about it, there aren’t a lot of concepts that we can’t explore under a 13+ framework. We’ve had religious cultists, evil space pirates, pon farr, a sentient holographic sexbot hologram, and a certain executive officer knocking up the admiral’s daughter on his first day on the job. And all of this was done and done well under a 13+ framework. Maybe we’ve pushed the limits from time to time, but we’ve been able to explore these concepts because…</p>
<p><b>4. Some things are best left to the imagination…</b></p>
<p>When it comes to sexual content and extreme violence, these are things which are often alluded to and rarely shown in mainstream entertainment. Now, there are some ratings reasons for that, but I think another key point to that is the fact that in a lot of cases, the details aren’t what’s interesting, the implications are. And, sometimes it can be more exciting to leave things up to the dirty little imaginations of the readers…</p>
<p><b>5.…and others are best left unsaid</b></p>
<p>Final thoughts</p>
<p>It is possible to run a good 18+ simm. However, a higher rating requires but is not necessarily indicative of a certain level of maturity. And, as I’m sure we can all imagine, combining a lack of maturity with an “anything goes” attitude can lead to ruin. While I don’t doubt the maturity of our writers, at the end of the day, I feel that if a 13+ rating is good enough for Star Trek, then it’s good enough for the USS Portland.</p>

<p><b>Quotes of the Month</b>
<p>“All members of the diplomatic corps are Ambassadors of the Federation when the need arises, Admiral — And occasionally nearby Bajoran children as well.”</br>-<i>Admiral Rodriguez</i></p>
<p>“From what I see in your record, you’re really quite… old.”</br>“Which is exactly what I keep telling the pub people.”</br>-<i>Marcus Kallan and Tyrlai Zade</i></p>
<p>“I am extremely disappointed that I was not involved in this escapade. An AI created for no good reason and left to run amok. I must be slipping. There was a time when something like this happened they would rouse me out of bed and search my quarters as step one of the investigation.”</br>-<i>Tyrlai Zade</i></p>
<p>“Sure, I’d like that, and I introduce to Jena, the daughter I never knew I had.”</br>“You, a daddy? Now that’s something.”</br>–<i>Jason Beauvoir and Marcus Kallan</i></p>
<p>“What is with that guy?”</br>“I know, right!”</br>-<i>Holo-Meru and Nikki Barclay, about Marcus Kallan</i></p>
<p>“I didn’t realize Tyrlai had a daughter. Alenia… I’m honoured,”</br>-<i>Vedek Alenis</i></p>
<p>“It turns out this wasn’t a shard of the orb of the pah wraiths after all. It’s part of the Orb of Life and the damn thing is youth-ing me to death. It’s taken all these years to de-age the symbiont but we are both teenagers now and I expect we have about three months to live. I can explain at length if you like but the short version is, I need to steal the Portland for a week or so, it was testing a new type of shielding that will withstand the worst of the badlands, I need to fetch the other tolic shards out of a ruined Bajoran ship and put them back together so the wormhole Aliens can resurrect Alenis.”</br>-<i>“Alenia” Zade</i></p>
<p>“But I should remind you that no one has stolen a starship from a Federation facility in over a hundred and twenty five years, and the punishment for getting caught is severe. I can’t let you do this…”</br>“I believe that is our own choice whether or not we risk our careers.”</br>“We helped save you.”</br>“…not without your former captain and his religious advisor. “</br>–<i>Vedek Alenis, Coln Jena, and Sera Williams</i></p>
<p>“I see you haven’t grown out of your arrogant and impulsive nature, Lieutenant. It’s a shame because you are an otherwise fine officer.”</br>“And you’re still a pompous ass…sir.”</br>–<i>Admiral Cresswell and Jason Beauvoir</i></p>
<p>“However, if it is your contention that the holo-program is, as you say, more than a replicator, you will need to back that up. Does she have a conscience and subconsciousness, or is it simply executing the commands in its subroutines? Is she self-aware, or is it simply programmed to ask itself existential questions? Is the EMH a sentient being, or simply programmed to imitate one by its creators? That, right there, is the crux of the matters, wouldn’t you agree?”</br>“I think that question could be applied to us. Are we not just a collection of organic circuitry and processors? Down deep, we are programmed to survive and to continue the species, but we have self-taught ourselves to become what we are today.”</br>–<i>Admiral Washington and Sera Williams</i></p>
<p>“That was a lot of travelling around. Can I ask why it happened? It must have been difficult on the children also not having a consistent place.”</br>“Lets just say that while they are certainly unique and wonderful, some people consider these children to be less than ideal tenants. Zero and One managed to knock out the main computer system on Jupiter Station for three days, and lets just say that the captain of Starbase 38 tired of Novia’s daily request for use of the long range sensor array. Of course, I’m sure they will fit in on the Portland. That is, so long as Novia’s alien cat monkeys don’t get into the Jeffries tubes.”</br>-<i>Eilis Ross &amp; Rostrenen T’Sering</i></p>
