<p><b>USS Portland en route to Gamia III</b></br><i>Clark Kent</i></p>
<img src="images/clark.jpg">
<p>After fighting off Orion pirates and returning the fight Tolic Shard to Bajor, the USS Portland, under the command of the distinguished Cmdr. Alenis Meru, has been dispatched to Gamia III to open diplomatic relations with the natives, a lost tribe of Bajor.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to reopen contact with a lost tribe, and we welcome them with open arms to rejoin with Bajor,” said Tora Celes, the foreign minister of Bajor. “Between the lost tribes and refugees from the occupation, the Bajoran people have been scattered all across the galaxy. The prophets willing, they should all be able to return home.”</p>
<p>As Bajor is a member world of the federation, Federation diplomats will be participating in the negotiations. “I’ve assignesd some of my most… talented officers to this very important file,” said Admiral Washington of Starfleet. “The Federation wholly supports the Bajorans in their efforts to reunite with the lost tribes of Gamia III.”</p>
<p>Rumours of an intimate encounter between Cmdr. Alenis and another Starfleet officer in the temple gardens of Ashalla are unconfirmed at this time.</p>

<p>In August, we had 22 posts, 21 in the main mission and one in the lower decks. However, if we count JP’s as one post per participant as many Nova simms do, then that would be a total of 48 participant-posts. It’s an impressive sum, and I think it’s clear that the Portland is one of the more active ships in the fleet. Let’s shoot for 30 next month!</p>
<p>A lot of our players (including the captain!) have been busy or on LOA as of late, so activity has been down somewhat as of late. Players are reminded to post an LOA if they’re going to be away for a while, and consider allowing someone else to write for your character if you are in the midst of a scene, just so that we aren’t tagging people and wondering what is going on as we wait for replies</p>

<p><b>Better Know a Player</b></br><i>Interview with Lieutenant Jason Beauvoir</i></p>
<p>For the second installment of our hopefully long-running series “better know a player,” I sat down and interviewed Jared, who plays Lieutenant Jason Beauvoir, the Chief Science Officer of the USS Portland.</p>
<p>Q: Tell us a little about the player behind Jason.</p>
<p>J: Well almost four decades ago, I was born New Zealand to a Yorkshire born father and a New Zealand born mother. I’ve always had a love of science and language, words fascinate me. I’m what you might call a perpetual student. I have qualifications in computer repair, Science (lab tech work), Literacy tutoring as well as a Bachelor of Arts in Classics and Linguistics. I love to learn, something that I find difficult due to my Dyspraxia, a learning disability related to Dyslexia. I have a gift for remembering song lyrics, a talent I’ve yet to find a practical use for. Having grown up in what may be called a New Age household, I am skeptical of religion, but still believe in meditation and astrology. Besides Star Trek, I also enjoy Doctor Who, the Original Battlestar Galactica, Blake’s Seven, Stargate, as well as Murder Mysteries, Westerns, Shakespeare, and procedural crime dramas like CSI, NCIS, and the Law and Order spinoffs. I am currently single, have one brother, three step-sisters and a step brother and two step-parents, as both my parents have remarried.</p>
<p>Q: How did you get into Star Trek?</p>
<p>J: I began watching The Original Series reruns as a young kid and then watched the movies, and The Next Generation when it first aired here. Since then I’ve watched every Star Trek Movie and TV, including recently watching The Animated Series.</p>
<p>Q: And how about simming? How did you find simming, and find your way to our little corner of the simming universe?</p>
<p>J: I began simming in late 2009 with Jason as my first character. Since then I’ve been in multiple simms that have all come to an end. I’ve met some great people, some of which I still write with on OF. My latest simm was winding down and I saw on facebook that one of my friends was on OF, wishing to write with him again, I contacted him and he introduced me to the site, and I joined his ship . I was happy to discover that one of my other friends, Agnes (who plays the Portland’s XO, Tim Rouse) was also onboard. There I met some new friends, but I felt Jason didn’t fit in there and neither did I, so when some of the crew left, I followed them to the Portland.</p>
<p>Q: What is your favourite part about simming and about the USS Portland?</p>
<p>J: My favourite part of simming is exploring the characters I create and how they interact with those of the rest of the crew. My favourite thing about the Portland is the other writers and how welcome and relaxed I feel writing there.</p>
<p>Q: Tell me about Jason. You’ve played him for a while now on multiple different simms, so you’ve had a lot of time to develop him. What makes him tick, and what kind of adventures has he been on so far?
<p>J: Jason started off as a lowly Linguistics Officer on Akira Class starship. Since then in different time periods and ships he’s been Chief Science Officer or Chief Operations Officer on several vessels, Second Officer (where it was a standalone position) on a fleet flag ship, XO on another version of that flag ship. He’s even been a French Airforce officer in a Stargate simm and a French army officer in a Walking Dead simm.</p>
<p>What makes him tick? He is fiercely loyal to his friends and crew mates, he’s not afraid to question or disobey orders or regulations that he finds immoral or cruel. He has an inquisitive mind that sometimes gets him in trouble. He doesn’t enjoy leadership, but doesn’t shy away from it either. He has a dislike of Klingons and is not afraid to share that with any that he may come across. His animosity towards his mother for what he sees is abandonment, something that will mean that he’ll never do the same to Jena. His grief at the senseless death of his lover and lifelong friend Sarah Patterson.
As for adventures; he’s commanded a ship during battle, interrogated enemy combatants, treated injured, led an away team/rescue mission under fire, brought up a teenage daughter, and thrown a dinner party among other things.</p>
<p>Q: Do you have any plans for Jason in the future?</p>
<p>J: Yes and they revolve around him getting vengeance for Sarah’s death or perhaps come to terms with it.</p>
<p>Q: Coln Jena, Jason’s estranged daughter, is also an interesting character, and introducing a 14 year old daughter that Jason didn’t know he had is definitely an interesting story. How did you come up with this idea?</p>
<p>J: I was on a Star Trek simm about an exploratory force to Andromeda and I thought it would make an interesting twist she was 16 in that simm which was set in 2395 and eventual she joined the academy cadet program.</p>
<p>Q: Do you have any plans for Jason and Jena as their father-daughter relationship develops?</p>
<p>J: No definite plans, I just see what develops.</p>
<p>Q: What other characters do you play in Obsidian Fleet?</p>
<p>J: In no particular order, I play; Lt. Yvette Beauvoir, Jason’s sister and currently XO of the USS Tripoli. Lt. Owen Reeves, Chief Science Officer and Second Officer of the USS Endeavour, and Commander Anahera Chernova, CO of the USS Deimos.</p>
<p>Q: You’ve recently jumped from being a player to being a CO, having taken on command of the USS Deimos in Task Force 21. How has your experience jumping into the center chair been? Have you found that running your own simm has changed your perspective on simming?</p>
<p>J: In a word, scary. I’d say that running my own simm has indeed changed my perspective, normally I do a lot of research when I create my characters and make vague plans for them, but more or less have them react to what happens, but as a CO, I have to plan the missions and am more or less in charge of where the story goes and my crew members tend to come up with questions that I’ve not even thought of. So in summation simming used to be the one place in my life where structure was of less importance, and now it isn’t.</p>
<p>Q: Last question – we just have to know – what is your favourite Star Trek series, movie and captain?</p>
<p>J: This is the most difficult question, as I like them all (except the JJ. Abrams reboot and Enterprise). Series: the Original Series only slightly beats The Next Generation.
Movie: First Contact (I love time travel and angry Picard). Captain: Picard only slightly beats Kirk.</p>
<p><i>Thank you. Jared, consider yourself better known!</i></p>

<p>“Consider me your personal assistant.” Abdel began sorting through the PADDs under his arm. “Filing, paperwork, preparing transcriptions…” he paused. “Fetching coffee, and anything else you need or desire.”</br>“Anything?” she asked, stifling a schoolgirl giggle as an inappropriate thought ran through her head. He didn’t look older than 25; perhaps if she were ten or fifteen years younger and single… “Well, there is one thing you can do for me,” she said, a mischievous smile on her face.</br>“Yes, captain?”</br>“File this paperwork for me,” she said, waving her arm over the giant pile of paperwork on her desk. She was going to enjoy having a yeoman.</br>-<i>Cmdr. Alenis Meru and Yeoman Abdel al-Nablusi</i></p>
<p>“NNNNNOooo!” He spit out. “What the heck!!!!!!” He growled immediately reaching into his tool box for his mechanic rag. “Why does this crap always have to happen!?”</br>As he leaned over to sop up the tea with his rag, Parker heard the whoosh of a door opening behind him. “You must be here to fix my replicator,” said a female voice from behind the mechanic’s back, “but what are you doing with my chair?”</br>-<i>Lt. Parker Hudson and Cmdr. Alenis Meru, after tea was spilled on her chair.</i></p>

<p>“I’m in charge of creative acquisitions, firing torpedos from forty years ago, chasing book thieves in dance clubs, frightening the children, escaping from pirate ships and swordfighting… Oh! And diplomacy, I always forget that.”</br>-<i>Lt. Tyrlai Zade</i></p>
