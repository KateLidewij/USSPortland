<p><b>USS Deimos Encounters Hostile Unknown Species</b></br><i>Clark Kent</i></p>
<img src="images/clark.jpg">
<p>The USS Deimos, on its shakedown cruise, has encountered a previously unknown insectoid species known as the Varrikk making claims to Federation territory.  Preliminary reports indicate that the unknown species is engaged in asteroid mining, and worships a ‘Great Beetle.’</p>
<p>Where the Varrikk come from and their intentions in Federation space are as of yet unknown.  We will be watching the story as it unfolds.</p>

<p><b>Romulans Return to Hobus</b></br><i>Rostrenen T'Sering</i></p>
<img src="images/rostrenen.jpg">
<p>According to the latest briefs from Starfleet Intelligence, the Romulan Galae had dispatched a vessel to the Hobus system to do preliminary scans and surveys of the remnants of the system.  The IRW Kholhr, under the command of Riov S’Havraha, has been dispatched.  Starfleet Intelligence has not confirmed or denied rumours that a Federation citizen is aboard the Kholhr.</p>
<p>According to unofficial sources, a listening post in the Gamma-Gamma-Kappa sector has uncovered evidence of a recent battle between multiple Romulan vessels.  Starfleet Command has not confirmed or denied the veracity of these sources.</p>

<p><b>Chief Morale Officer’s Report</b></br><i>Acting Ensign Ko-ko</i></p>
<img src="images/koko.jpg">
<p>January has been another solid month on the Portland, with a total of 48 posts.  This is down a little bit from our last few months, but we do have the really big battle scene JP that we are working on which hasn’t been posted yet.</p>
<p>We’re currently in the midst of an exciting battle with the Borg, and will hopefully wrap up this scene and this mission shortly.  The command staff is currently working on a starter post for Mission Seven, so expect that to go online within the next few days.  Mission Seven will take place on Trill, and will involve repairs to the Portland, an AI symposium, shore leave, and some exciting complications.</p>
<p>Starting a new mission will be a good chance to have a fresh start if you’re feeling a little lost, so start thinking about what you might want for your character this mission.  Feel free to push your characters beyond their comfort zone a little as well – that’s where things get exciting!</p>

<p><b>Better Know a Sister Ship - Starbase 47</b></br><i>Captain Alenis Meru</i></p>
<img src="images/meru.jpg">
<p>This month’s Sister Ship to get Better Known isn’t a ship at all, but a station.  We have the distinct pleasure of chatting with Captain Oliver Lancaster of Starbase 47.  Captain Lancaster is currently the Senior Ship Commanding Officer of TG72A and his simm is a sister ship of the USS Portland.</p>
<p>Before we start taking about the simm, why don’t you tell me a little about yourself and your character?</p>
<p>Okay then, where to start? I’m Ben, I’m a twenty-something aspiring actor writer and director from the UK who’s been simming since 2008, and who recently graduated university. I’ve had two previous stints as a CO, one barely worth noting a couple of years ago, then one that ran early 2009 to late 2012, by the end of which is was the TGCO for 47-B and which ended due to my time inavailability; I was bordering on AWOL with how bogged down starting uni had made me!</p>
<p>As for my character, Oliver is one that really has evolved over time. When he was first envisioned, he was this by the book Officer. However, he grew up and almost learnt the lessons we’ve seen on the show with the various Captains; you can’t always follow the rules. Now, he’s a bit more of a maverick, a bit more head strong and no longer has a stick up his backside! How much of this stemmed from our Requiem plot, which we’ve literally just finished the sequel to, wherein he was infected with what turned out to be modified Borg Nano Probes, enhancing his physical and mental abilities whilst also affecting his mental state to a currently unknown degree, as well as his metabolism, with him eating, and I’m quoting from a JP I’m currently in here, “five or six meals a day” just to keep going, remains to be seen!</p>
<p>Starbase 47 wasn’t originally a starbase; it was the USS Asphodel.  Why did you decide to change over from a ship to a base?</p>
<p>I’d been contemplating changing classes for a little while to one with a little more versatility; I loved the Elysium Class, but there were instances where I struggled to write interesting missions using the ship towards the end of my days as Asphodel’s CO. My original idea was to transfer to a Galaxy Class ship. I’d even gone through the ship list and checked ship names against what was an open sim to avoid pinching any sims TGCO’s were trying to get a CO for at the time, save messing people about unnecessarily. God, you really can tell I’m British when I say that! (Laughs) However, I felt it was more fair to put it up to a vote for my crew. At that point, I was considering a Starbase as well, but it was more of a backburner. However, the vote went through, the crew were in favour of a Starbase and here we are!</p>
<p>If you were to sum up the concept for Starbase 47, what would it be, and how did you come up with it?</p>
<p>It’s DS9 in the Delta Quadrant. (Laughs) I wish I could say that was nowhere near true, but a fair part of the concept is along the lines of hybridizing the concepts of DS9 and Voyager. Originally, I wanted to put us in the Gamma Quadrant. Then Brian told me that had been done and suggested the Delta Quadrant instead, along with pointing me in the right direction to the Barzan Wormhole. Cards on the table, if he hadn’t done that, I would’ve been stuck out in the cold in regards to getting the base there. Actually, I probably, given my Science Officer had just suggested doing a mission with a member of the Q Continuum, have used said Q to create an artificial wormhole, or had the crew find some alien structure. However, that wasn’t necessary and we managed it.</p>
<p>We’ve also got a unique selling point I wasn’t sure we’d be able to have when I first e-mailed R&amp;D about one of the components; we’ve got a Klingon Bird of Prey as one of our support ships, as part of an arrangement to allow the Klingons to operate from the Starbase as well, making it a joint Federation-Klingon venture, with both Governments contributing resources, something I hope to explore in more depth in the future.</p>
<p>You’re planning a partnership with the USS Endeavour, another sister ship in 72A.  Can you tell us a little about your ideas for that?</p>
<p>At the moment, it’s very early days. Essentially, and I do hope he’ll correct me if I’m wrong, it’s very much along the lines of when multiple Trek series ran at the same time; they were in the same universe and there was room for overlap. I know I’ve invited the CO over to make an appearance sometime during the course of SB47’s next mission, his schedule permitting, and I hope to see many occurrences such as that to help build a bit more of a continuity between the fleet.</p>
<p>You’ve been able to run through a lot of missions fairly quickly on SB47 and the Asphodel.  What’s your secret?</p>
<p>A small crew! (Laughs) Seriously, that is my big secret. It’s partly organization, though my crew will tell you, at times, I suck at that and get a bit wrapped up in posts which can drag them out. Now that we’ve picked up crew wise, having gone from six to ten in the last three months, I don’t know if it’s going to continue to be one a month. Probably not, given our last mission ended up taking three months, like our earlier ones did!</p>
<p>In all this time, would you have a favourite mission?</p>
<p>That’s a tough one for me. As the CO, I’ve done a large amount of plotting for each one, though I have also tended to include various crew members, especially my XO and Science Officer, in the plotting of them. However, I think it’s a toss up between ‘Apocalypse’, where we found ourselves in a future with the Federation nearly destroyed at the hands of the Romulans, a scenario partly inspired by the TNG episode Yesterday’s Enterprise, and partly by my love for dystopian sci-fi and the current trend of how popular it is, or the mission we’ve just done, ‘Contagion/Assimilation’, wherein we’ve faced the Borg, expanded on the ‘Requiem’ plot from last year and also introduced our new Bird of Prey in true fighting style; against a few waves of Borg ships, in two of, in my opinion, the best battle posts I’ve been involved in as a CO, which I have to thank my XO for keeping on track!</p>
<p>Final thoughts?</p>
<p>A couple. First of all, thank you all for taking the time to read my inane ramblings, though they have been somewhat curbed by the fact I was given questions to answer rather than just given an article to write! I’d like to thank the editor for inviting me to this interview, and I’d like to thank my crew for being absolutely fantastic of late! I’d also like to say if any Task Forces have a TGCO spot opening up, please feel free to drop me a line, we’ll talk! (Laughs) Other than that, my final thoughts are this; I’ve seen this fleet change and grow in the last seven and a half years, and I’ve seen this TG flourish under it’s current TGCO. The people running the ships and the TG’s don’t always get enough praise, so I’d like to take a moment to thank each and every one of them; if we didn’t have brilliant people to write with, we wouldn’t get better and simms like mine would’ve stagnated long ago! So thank you one and all!</p>

<p><b>Quotes of the Month</b></p>
<P>“So when do I schedule an appointment with our Chief Morale Officer?”</br>“I’ll pencil you in for next Thursday, assuming we survive our encounter with the Borg.”</br>– <i>Gregory Paladin and Alenis Meru</i></p>
<P>“Hello Ensign Ko-ko.”</br>– <i>Ash Sullivan</i></p>
<P>“Must be nice. Having someone to look up to. You know, my father died in service at Wolf 359. And my sister. We got separated in the evacuation corridor… My whole career has been devoted to learning about the Borg. Figuring them out. Learning how to beat them. You’ve had a hero to look up to. I’ve just had revenge dressed up in Starfleet’s higher purpose.  Is that all there is, Nikki? All there is to what I am?”</br>“Oh, Marcus, you’re so much more than that. Just think of all you’ve done for the Portland in the short time you’ve been here, and what you did for Holo-Meru. And…” she paused for a moment, looking into his eyes, “I know it might be hard to believe, but you have people who care about you.”</br>“So, uh, on that subject… ever since shore leave, I’ve been meaning to, ah, ask you something. Where do we stand? With each other.” His speaking increased in speed rapidly, not unlike how Nikki winds up. “I mean, I’m perfectly okay with being professionals about this. We’re in different departments and everything, so there wouldn’t be a conflict of interest, so that’s good, but…”</br>As Marcus rambled on, Nikki leaned in closer. Then, without warning, she kissed him softly on the cheek. “Has anyone ever told you that you ramble sometimes?”</br>– <i>Marcus Kallan and Nikki Barclay</i></p>
<P>“Captain to Protein Cube…”</br>“Here I am! How can I help, Captain? You know, I’m **always** eager to help!”</br>– <i>Holographic representations of Alenis Meru and Marcus Kallan</i></p>
<P>“Signal to Starfleet that the Gre’thor awaits battle and that the Klingons await Sto-Vo-Kor!”</br>– <i>General Mar’Dok</i></p>
<P>“Very good…Helm, set course for NGC-3814”</br>“Course plotted and laid in, Captain… Our in-flight holo-vid today will be Captain Proton and the Saucer of the Snake People.”</br>– <i>Alenis Meru and Kahnr Dai</i></p>
<P>“Ronald?  Can you help me decorate the warp core?”</br>– <i>Nikki Barclay</i></p>
