<p><b>IRW Kholhr thwarts Romulan insurgents</b></br><i>Rostrenen T'Sering</i></p>
<img src="images/rostrenen.jpg">
<p>The Imperial Romulan Warbird Kholhr has been working on finding the real reason behind a massing of resources and warbirds in the Hobus and Eisn systems, only to discover a massive ring starbase and the plans to start the empire anew.</p>
<p>A self-proclaimed Commander ir’Faen has begun plans to take over the seat of the Empire and Praetor, returning it to their home system of Eisn. The base and eventual fleet of sympathizing warbirds would be used as a coup, and then leverage to get the Senate to side with them and overthrow the Praetor.</p>
<p>But the Kholhr got in the way. S’Havraha and his faithful crew got in the way. The Galae, the Senate, ir’Faen himself – no one saw it coming, and yet a single Valdore nullified the massive plot. And the Romulan Star Empire will remain strong as it partners with the Federation to thrive and grow, and keep the war efforts against the Klingons and others that would seek to destroy them.</p>
<p>Four long years after Hobus, the Romulan Empire still stands strong, with honor, as a major player in the galaxy. People like the crew of the Kholhr help ensure that.</p>

<p><b>Chief Morale Officer’s Report</b></br><i>Acting Ensign Ko-ko</i></p>
<img src="images/koko.jpg">
<p>So, the past couple months have seen some ups and downs and a lot happening.  we had a bit of a down month this past month.  We put out 15 posts, which isn’t terrible, but it’s far lower than what our average had been in previous months.  A large part of this was due to the command staff and our busy life situations over the past couple months, but I’m hoping this will level out soon.  In addition, we plan to reach out to some people who haven’t posted in a while and try to determine whether they’re still interested in the Portland or if they have moved on.</p>
<p>On the plus side, with the posting of the victory party, Mission Six is finally, completely, 100% over.  Congrats to everyone who was a part of it!  Hmmmmmm… I think to celebrate we should perhaps have a round of awards?</p>
<p>Mission Seven is moving forward; we have some free time on Trill for character development, or if that’s a little slow for you, Tyrlai is leading a team to acquire a Breen freighter for our next mission.  Feel free to jump in; it’s guaranteed to have 30% more scum and 50% more villainy than anything on Trill!</p>
<p>Finally, the Portland won two very prestigious awards recently – winning Obsidian Fleet’s Simm of the Year for 2015, as well as taking home the Excellence in Story award at the annual Tournament of Simulations for our time travel plot in mission four.  Congrats to everyone who made this possible; award cards for the site are on my massive to-do list!</p>

<p><i>Better Know an NPC - Ensign Nikki Barclay</i></p>
<p>For this month’s edition of Better Know an NPC, we sat down with Ensign Nikki Barclay from Engineering.  Nikki is fresh out of the academy, and is excited to sit down with us and talk about her experiences on the Portland.</p>
<p>PP:  Thanks for sitting down with us.  I suppose I will get right into it; why did you join Starfleet?</p>
<p>NB:  Well, there are a lot of reasons.  Since I was a small child, I would look up at the stars.  I knew my uncle Reg served on a ship, and I would wonder where he was and what sort of adventures he was having.  Did I ever tell you about my uncle Reg?  He’s so awesome.  He’s like an ideal Starfleet officer; he fought the Borg, served with Captain Picard, and helped bring Voyager home.  He’s just so awesome and…</p>
<p>Oh right, why I joined Starfleet.  I wanted to see the stars and discover the mysteries of the universe.  That was the main reason.  But also, my family said that the academy might be good for me.  They said it would help calm me down and give me some self-discipline, as though I need that.  I’m not some kind of spaz…</p>
<p>PP:  …Fascinating.  According to your transcript, you did fairly well at the Academy.  Well enough to have some choice in your assignment; why did you choose the USS Portland?</p>
<p>NB:  I just love tinkering with old systems!  There’s just something about the mix of older technology and newer refits that lets me get lost in EPS flow diagrams for days.  It’s just so fascinating; duotronic relays, isolinear systems… I just love these old ships!  And, did you know that my Uncle Reg’s first assignment was on a Miranda class?</p>
<p>PP:  I… did not know that.  You must really look up to him.</p>
<p>NB:  Of course!  He’s like the bravest, strongest, smartest, most awesome Starfleet officer ever!  Did I ever tell you about the time he shook hands with Zephram Cochrane?</p>
<p>PP:  Several times.  Moving on, how have you been fitting into the Engineering crew?</p>
<p>NB:  It’s been great.  I’m so happy to have Sera back.  I thought she was a goner after she took that dark energy radiation pulse, but now that that jerkbag Shras is gone, we’re like a big happy family again.  Malbi even let me try some of her gagh earlier today; I only choked and spit up half of it.  I hope it doesn’t crawl around in my stomach too much, or end up laying eggs, or… I think I need to go see Doctor Silverton.</p>
<p>PP:  Relax.  Even the freshest gagh only lives for a few seconds in your stomach.</p>
<p>NB:  But… what if it got caught in my throat or something?  I think I feel something squirming in my mouth; can I have that glass of water?”</p>
<p>PP:  That’s… hmmmmm… feeling better?</p>
<p>NB:  I think so.  But maybe I should visit Dr. Silverton after this interview to be sure.</p>
<p>PP:  Sounds like a plan.  Anyways, on the subject of relationships, I know you and Marcus–</p>
<p>NB:  Protein Cube!  He’s just so cute… I know we didn’t get along at the start, but I get the feeling that once we got to know each other, we found out that we are more alike than we thought.  We both get lost in our work, and sometimes have trouble with other people.  But being with him makes me feel like I’m not alone in the universe… omigod, that sounded so corny, can you edit it out?</p>
<p>PP:  Of course.  Anyways, do you have any ideas for character development down the road?</p
<p>NB:  Well, I’d like to build my relationship with Marcus, and hopefully work on some new and fascinating challenges in Engineering.  Sera mentioned something about a Breen freighter;</p>
<p>PP:  Thank you again, Ensign Barclay.  I have to say, you are a fascinating character on the USS Portland—</p>
<p>NB:  Character?  You keep using that word, as though we’re all characters in a holo-program and don’t even… omigod, nothing is real!  We’re all part of someone’s imagination!  Computer, end program!!!</p>

<p><b>Quotes of the Month</b></p>
<p>“RIn ngoS tlhogh cha! Q’apla!” (Our marriage is over!)</br>- <i>General Mar’dok, to Judith Rouse</i></p>
<p>“Come now, dear. This is the twenty-fourth century! We’ve fixed decades neglected derelict space stations. We’ve fixed and made planets! This old boat’ll be fine. And, worst case scenario, we just go back in time and prevent most of this damage from even happening. Though… I suppose if we were to do that we already would have, huh?”</br>“Well, we have done it before… or in the future… or something like that…”</br>– <i>Ronald Roberts and Nikki Barclay</i></p>
<p>“Actually, not to be a Debbie Downer or anything, but it’s impossible to back up your program. You’re as fragile as any of us, Nerys. Please be careful… And don’t break Jason, either.”</br>– <i>Marcus Kallan</i></p>
<p>“…Without divulging Starfleet confidential information, I think it’s safe to say that mostly everyone in this room has heard of the notable simulations to exhibit sentient or near-sentient qualities. Ladies and gentlemen and non- and complex- gendered species, this blows the lid off of accidental sentience. I predict with three-sigma confidence that entropy-induced sentience events will only increase in the next five years, with math still being formulated that will bring things closer to five-sigma…”</br>– <i>Marcus Kallan</i></p>
