<h3>Starfleet Regulations</h3>
<p>Our goals on the USS Portland can be summed up in three simple points. Together, these three points form a sort of Prime Directive which guides what we do here. They are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>To tell cool and interesting stories</li>
<li>To explore and develop our characters</li>
<li>To have fun</li></ol></br>
<p>And, because there is nothing more fun than rules and regulations, we’ve got some simple ground rules here which enable us to have an optimal level of fun.</p>
<p><b>1. Don’t be a dick</b></br>
This one is pretty self-explanatory. It’s hard to have fun when people are being dicks. So don’t do it.</p>
<p><b>2. Participate!</b></br>
Obsidian Fleet rules require that players post at least once every two weeks. However, that is a minimum and we'd all like to see people strive for more. Especially for command staff and department heads, who should be posting at least weekly. It is important that players post actively, because if we aren’t actively posting, we aren’t telling cool and interesting stories. It’s also not fair to other players and potential applicants if someone is taking up a spot on the Portland and not participating. We’ll give you reasonable warnings and a reasonable amount of time to get active again, but failure to post can result in removal and us finding someone else for your position. If you’re feeling left out, feel free to seek out any of the command staff and we’ll help you get involved with the story or get something going on The Lower Decks.</p>
<p><b>3. Don't leave us hanging!</b></br>
If someone tags you in a post, they're handing the scene over to you. But if you don't respond, it's difficult to move the scene forward. So if you're tagged in a post, please try to respond to that tag as soon as possible so we can continue to move the story forward. Generally, you should be responding to tags within three days at the most. But the faster you respond, the better. If you can't, let the command staff know so we can figure out a workaround.</p>
<p><b>4. If you’re going away for a while, post an LOA</b></br>
We all get it. Sometimes life can get too busy for one to spend time dealing with imaginary people on an imaginary spaceship. We don’t need to know all the gritty details, but if you’re going to be away for a while, do the courteous thing and let people know so we aren’t waiting on hanging tags that won’t be answered until you get back from an archaeological dig on Easter Island six months from now. Consider giving someone permission to write your character when you’re gone if the spotlight is tipping in your direction.</p>
<p><b>5. Don’t use other people’s characters without their permission</b></br>
A little bit to move the plot forward here and there is generally okay, but try not to take control of other people’s characters without their permission. They may have had something in mind for their character. If you’ve got to interact with them, it sounds like a great opportunity for a JP!</p>
<p><b>6. Move the story forward in cool and interesting directions</b></br>
Simming isn’t competitive, it’s an exercise in collaborative storytelling. We’re all on the same team, and our goal is to tell cool and interesting stories. These stories are bigger than our individual characters, and our characters exist in service of the story. With that in mind, let us all work to tell the best stories we can.</p>
<p><b>7. Build off of each other and make each other look awesome</b></br>
Role-playing works the best when we try to say “yes” to each other’s ideas – especially when it is something that may be outside of your character’s comfort zone. Blocking each other gets us nowhere and does nothing to advance the story. Always strive to find reasons why your character can do – or at least try – something rather than why she can’t. And remember to share the spotlight with other characters so we can all participate and be awesome.</p>
<p><b>8. Stick to the setting</b></br>
At the same time, this is set in the universe of Star Trek. We all agreed to that when we signed up for the USS Portland instead of a Star Wars RPG. We should be embracing the setting and all of its quirks and limitations and using it to tell our stories. This doesn’t mean we have to be sticklers for canon. After all, the numerous little inconsistencies that one can find in Trek if one looks hard enough are an indication that not even the writers are sticklers for canon. But try to write in such a way that is more or less in keeping with the world of Trek. The Portland is also a 13+ simm, so avoid the sort of profanity, graphic violence, and graphic depictions of sex that we wouldn't see in your typical Star Trek episode.</p>
<p><b>9. If in doubt, ask!</b></br>
It’s easier to write together when we’re all on the same page. An ounce of OOC discussion can prevent a pound of headaches later on. We’ve got plenty of avenues to discuss things, clarify them, hash things out, and work together to figure out how to make the Portland the best ship it can be. So let’s use them to our advantage.</p>
<p><b>10. Have fun!</b></br>
On the USS Portland, every day is Mandatory Fun Day!So have fun!</p>

<section id="rank FAQ">
<h3>Ranks &amp; Promotions FAQ</h3>
<p><b>What ranks are available?</b></p>
<p>There are three kinds of ranks: Enlisted, Commission Officers, and Flag Officers.
<p>The difference is that Enlisted ranks just have basic training, while Commissioned Officers have gone through a four year officer training course at Starfleet Academy. Flag Officers are the admiralty, and that is above the pay grade of anyone on the Portland.</p>
<p>Most player characters will be Commissioned Officers, as they tend to be the ones who are the stars of the show and occupy important positions such as Department Heads. However, there may be some enlisted crewmen bouncing around and they may occupy prominent roles based on specialized knowledge that they hold despite not having completed officer training. For example, Chief O'Brien was an enlisted crewman, but he wound up being Chief Engineer on Deep Space 9 based on his technical skills and knowledge. Additionally, we may have civilians on board in various capacities.</p>
<p>A list of ranks is available <a href="http://www.obsidianfleet.net/index.php?option=articles&task=show&artid=20">here</a></p>
<p>There are some rules on ranks, available <a href="http://www.obsidianfleet.net/index.php?option=articles&task=show&artid=105">here</a></p>
<p><b>Do ranks mean anything out of character?</b></p>
<p>No. On the Portland, everyone is equal. Except for the command staff, who are more equal. Just because you hold a slightly higher rank than someone in-character doesn't mean you can boss them around out of character. Save the bossing people around for Tim &amp; Alenis.</p>
<p><b>How is my rank determined?</b></p>
<p>Initially, your rank is determined by the command staff, based on your position and the service record in your character's bio. Most department heads will hold a rank somewhere between Lt. (JG) and Lt. Cmdr. Assistant department heads will generally hold a rank lower than that, between Ensign and Lt. (JG). If your character has more experience in your bio, then you are more likely to hold a higher rank. We also tend to give initial ranks a little on the lower side, so we have some room to promote you later on.</p>
<p>Note: The above applies to everyone but the Commanding Officer, whose rank is determined by our TGCO &amp; TFCO.</p>
<p><b>When are promotions done?</b></p>
<p>Generally, they are done during breaks in the action, such as between missions or during shore leave. The command staff will generally consider whether to do promotions at the start or the end of a mission.</p>
<p><b>What are the criteria for promotions?</b></p>
<p>There are two main sets of criteria: in-character and out of character</p>
<p>In-character criteria: In-character criteria are things like your character's service record and their service on the Portland. Basically, to be eligible for a promotion, it has to make sense in-character that you might be up for one based on your character's experience and service.</p>
<p>Out of character criteria: Also, we like to reward players who are committed to the Portland, who post regularly, who produce high-quality posts, and who advance the story in cool and interesting ways. If you are an active and contributing member of the Portland, your chances of getting promoted go way up.</p>
<p><b>I've worked hard and posted lots, but my character is fresh out of the academy. It's not fair that I'm not getting a promotion!</b></p>
<p>Promotion in rank is only one way to reward players and characters, and unfortunately it doesn't always make sense in-character for someone to hold a higher rank than they currently hold. Also, it may not make sense at the moment to do a promotion, as we typically have to wait for a break in the action such as the end of one mission and the start of another. However, we do have other ways of recognizing your hard work, such as awards.</p>
<p>Besides, isn't the fun we've had roleplaying together it's own reward?</p></section>
<section id="award FAQ"><h3>Awards FAQ</h3>
<p><b>What are awards?</b></p>
<p>Awards are a way to recognize your accomplishments on the USS Portland. Awards are celebrated on the forums, and are entered into a character's IFS record in Obsidian Fleet.</p>
<p><b>What awards are available?</b></p>
<p>A full list of awards is available <a href="http://www.obsidianfleet.net/index.php?option=ifs&task=common&action=common&lib=alist&id=60">here</a>, along with descriptions of what criteria is required for which awards.</p>
<p><b>Can I display my awards?</b></p>
<p>Yes! Feel free to display the award ribbons in your signature and in your bio.</p>
<p><b>Do awards exist in-character?</b></p>
<p>No. Awards are solely out of character, and as such should not be mentioned on in-character posts.</p>
<p><b>How often are awards handed out?</b></p>
<p>Typically, the command staff will consider awards every couple of months or so. Additionally, there are some awards such as training badges and tour of duty awards which are handed out when they are earned.</p>
<p><b>How can I increase my chances of getting an award?</b></p>
<p>First, participate! Many of these awards require that you or your character do stuff. If you're not participating, it's hard to earn awards.</p>
<p>Secondly, write quality posts. You are more likely to receive an award for something if you write high-quality, detailed posts about it. For example, if your character has a budding romance, going into detail about your character's feelings will make it more likely that you will receive a Rose Award for this.</p>
<p><b>I think someone deserves an award. Can I nominate them?</b></p>
<p>Yes! To nominate someone for an award, simply contact the command staff and let us know who you feel is deserving, what award you are nominating them for, and why. Please note that while Level 1 awards are given out at the sole discretion of the command staff, Level 2 rewards require more documentation, and are subject to approval by the fleet.</p></section>
<section id="CSG"><h3>Custom Species Guide</h3>
<p>So, you’ve decided to create a custom (non-canon) race for your USS Portland character. Cool!</br>
Choosing whether to accept a custom race or not is up to the discretion of the USS Portland command staff, and you’ll need to provide us with a brief description of that race’s physical characteristics, culture, etc. Here are a few suggestions before you get started to maximize your chance of creating a fun, interesting custom race which will be accepted.</p>
<p><b>1. Ask yourself why you need a custom race</b></p>
<p>The galaxy of Star Trek is very diverse. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of races that have been established in the world of Star Trek. It would be a good idea to take a look at these before trying to create a custom race, as something which fits your concept might already exist. You want to play a cold logician? Try a Vulcan. A warrior with a code of honour? Klingons and Andorians fit the bill. A religious guy? Roll up a Bajoran.</p>
<p>If a canon race already exists that matches your concept fairly closely, it would be a good idea to consider using that instead. You’ll have the advantages of having resources out there on Memory Alpha and Memory Beta to use, and it will be easier for your fellow writers who all know what a Ferengi is but aren’t familiar with Trumpians.</p>
<p><b>2. Make sure you can interact with the environment and the characters around you!</b></p>
<p>You might think it would be cool to play a sentient cloud, but you’re going to run into some problems with that very quickly. How does your cloud talk to people? What sort of personality does it have? How does your intelligent floating cloud chief engineer change a burnt out plasma relay?</p>
<p>Before you create a giant centaur-like creature who is supposed to be an engineer but can’t fit through the Jeffries Tubes, make sure your character has the ability to interact with everyone else and do her duties. Here, it might be better to stick to something vaguely humanoid.</p>
<p><b>3. Why did your character join Starfleet?</b></p>
<p>This is an important question. If your character comes from a custom race that is barely out of the Bronze Age, you’re going to need to come up with a really good explanation as to how they wound up hurtling through the galaxy on a Federation starship. Make sure your custom race concept actually fits before you go all out.</p>
<p>(The above goes for a lot of canon alien races as well, particularly those hailing from non-Federation worlds)</p>
<p>That said, there’s nothing wrong with being the only one of your kind in Starfleet. Some of the best characters from Star Trek, such as Worf, Data, Odo, and Neelix are one of a kind.</p>
<p><b>4. Don’t be super-powered!</b></p>
<p>It’s okay to create a character who is well above average. After all, we’re not just Starfleet officers, we’re primary protagonists. That means that our characters are generally a little more badass than the average Joe.</p>
<p>That said, there is a line there somewhere. If Ensign Bloggins can use his species’ magical powers to snap his fingers and make a fleet of Borg cubes disappear, it can easily short-circuit entire stories and suck away all the dramatic tension. Consider strengths and weaknesses, and where your custom race has some sort of unique ability, try to make sure it’s somewhat balanced and not totally game-breaking.</p>
<p><b>5. Where did you come from?</b></p>
<p>Custom races are fine. Trying to shoehorn races from other fandoms such as Twilight vampires, furries, or Jabba the Hutt into Star Trek, a little less so. This isn’t meant to shut out any character ideas, or to stop you from using a picture from another movie or show to represent your character, but we’re a Star Trek RPG. If you want to play a Jedi, vampire or furry, you might be better off seeking out a community which caters to that sort of thing than trying to come up with a way to play Luke Skywalker in the world of Star Trek.</p>
<p><b>6. Make it cool!</b></p>
<p>The tabletop RPG 13th Age has a concept known as a One Unique Thing. This is something about your character which is totally unique in the universe, and which no other character possesses. When creating a custom race, think of your race’s One Unique Thing and make it cool!</p></section></div>
