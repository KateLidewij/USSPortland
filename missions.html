<h3>Mission 1: &quot;Not Until Tuesday&quot;</h3>
<a href="files/M1.pdf">Download full mission here!</a></br>
<p>While performing testing, the USS Portland has responded to a distress call from a civilian freighter. Starfleet command has confirmed that the USS Portland has engaged an Orion cruiser near sector 377.</p>
<p>No other details are available as of press time. Rumours that the Orion vessel is commanded by a former acquaintance of one of the senior staff of the Portland are unconfirmed.</p></section>

<h3>Mission 2: &quot;The Banquet&quot;</h3>
<a href="files/M2.pdf">Download full mission here!</a></br>
<p>The Bajorans will be one step closer to re-assembling a lost orb next Tuesday, when the fifth Tolic shard will be returned to Bajor at a ceremony honouring the return of the shard and the close relationship between the Federation and the Bajorans.</p>
<p>Details of the recovery are classified, however unofficial sources indicate that it was won in a hand of Tongo.</p>
<p>&quot;<italic>This Tolic shard is one of the most significant Bajoran cultural or religious artifacts to be returned in recent years,</italic>&quot; said Dr. Ishan Tillar, Professor of Archaeology at the University of Dhakur. &quot;<italic>This discovery is one more small step on the path to repairing the damage to Bajoran culture caused by the occupation.</italic>&quot;</p>
<p>With the fifth shard recovered, only one remains. Its whereabouts are unknown.</p></section>

<h3>Mission 3: &quot;Pilgrims&quot;</h3>
<a href="files/M3.pdf">Download full mission here!</a></br>
<p>This is the third mission of the USS Portland, which started in July 2014 and became our longest mission to date, running into April 2015.</p>
<p>In this mission, after returning the Tolic shard to its rightful owners, the Bajoran people, the USS Portland is tasked with handling a delicate diplomatic matter.</p>
<p>A lost tribe of Bajorans has been discovered on the strategically important planet of Gamia III. The USS Portland is assigned the job of escorting Bajoran diplomats to Gamia III with the goal of bringing the Gamians back into the fold. However, the Bajorans and the Federation are not the only people interested in the Gamia system, and not all is as it seems on the third planet…</p></section>

<h3>Mission 4: &quot;Requiem&quot;</h3>
<a href="files/M4.pdf">Download full mission here!</a></br>
<p>Captain Alenis Meru of the USS Portland has been reported killed in action during an away mission to Gamia III.</p>
<p>The circumstances of her death are not entirely clear, but preliminary reports indicate that she was killed in a cave on Gamia III during a confrontation with pah-wraith cultists. In accordance with standard procedure when a captain is killed in the line of duty, Admirals Washington, Cresswell, and Hurin will be leading a review of the conduct of the captain and her crew in the days leading up to her death.</p>
<p>Rumours that this confrontation and the death of the captain are somehow associated with Bajoran end times prophecies have so far been unsubstantiated. A funeral for the captain will be held on Deep Space Nine.</p></section>

<h3>Mission 5: &quot;Unto the Breach, Part One&quot;</h3>
<a href="files/M4.pdf">Download full mission here!</a></br>
<p>The Fleet has dispatched the USS Portland to investigate Borg activity in a nebula near the destroyed colony world. The century old ship has been equipped with the latest in experimental technology in what Starfleet hopes to be a successful first test of a new form of energy generation and ship propulsion. While the details of this experimental technology is classified, it is rumoured that the controversial scientist Shras th’Karath is the project leader.</p></section>

<h3>Mission 6: &quot;Unto the Breach, Part Two&quot;</h3>
<a href="files/M6.pdf">Download full mission here!</a></br>
<p>The Borg are back!!!</p>
<p>Upon entering the NGC-3814 nebula, the crew of the Portland found a Borg transwarp gate powered by a Dark Energy reactor.  If activated, this gate would allow the Borg to bring in massive reinforcements from the Delta Quadrant and catapult them anywhere within Federation space.  Teaming up with the USS Endeavour for a daring assault on the transwarp gate, can the crew of the Portland save the quadrant from an imminent Borg invasion?<p>
<p id="italic">Mission 6 was a Joint Mission with our Sister Ship the USS Endeavour.</p></section>

<h3>Mission 7: &quot;Troubles on Trill&quot;</h3>
<a href="files/M7.pdf">Download full mission here!</a></br>
<p>After the battle in the nebula, the Portland limps back to Trill for repairs and some much-needed shore leave.  But nothing is ever that simple, as the crew of the Portland has to deal with an AI symposium, angry parents, and the Captain’s desperate plot to not miss her spa day, as well as a looming feeling that with such heavy damage to such an old ship, that their time together is coming to an end…</p></section>

<h3>Mission 8: &quot;The Freighters of Acquisition&quot;</h3>
<a href="files/M8.pdf">Download full mission here!</a></br>
<p>Mission 8 runs concurrently and after Mission 7. It involves the crew of the Portland attempting to acquire a Breen freighter from a wretched hive of scum and villainy.</p></section>

<section id="M9"><img id="mission_banner" src="images/missions/M9.jpg">
<h3>Mission 9: &quot;Cold Case&quot;</h3>
<a href="files/M9.pdf">Download full mission here!(Will come soon!)</a></br>
<p>In Mission 9 the crew of the Portland will do what ever it takes to rescue one of their own from a Breen prison planet. Even disobeying a direct order not to attempt a rescue mission in Breen space.</p></section>

<section id="M10"><img id="mission_banner" src="images/missions/M10.jpg">
<h3>Mission 9: &quot;Cold Case&quot;</h3>
This is an active mission. Go <a href="#">here</a> to the mission.</br></br>
<p>A year after our last mission the crew of the Portland is almost going nuts of having a whole year of boring, unnoteworthy missions. But be careful what you wish for!. During a siplomatic mission Captain Alenis Meru gets infected with a virus that will change her in a creature that can only breath in water. The crew must work together with the locals to come up with a cure for the virus, where no cure excists for.</p></section></br>

<h3>Lower Decks: &quot;Meru Mysteries&quot;</h3>
<a href="http://104.207.159.135:4567/topic/10/meru-mysteries">Go to the mission!</a></br>
<p>Meru Mysteries is a Victorian-era holodeck mystery story, that's basicly a ripoff of Murdoch Mysteries. There's a twist though. Meru Mysteries will also be an experiment in the Open Role-Playing format. For more info go <a href="http://104.207.159.135:4567/topic/9/ooc-meru-mysteries">here.</a></p></section>

<h3>Lower Decks: &quot;Incursion&quot;</h3>
<a href="http://104.207.159.135:4567/topic/11/incursion">Go to the mission!</a></br>
<p>When a shuttle ferrying some new officers to the Portland slams into a subspace vacuole at high warp, a bit of quick thinking saves the shuttle and its occupations. Everything seems to be all right, until they meet up with Captain Andrew Rouse of the ISS Portland… For more info go <a href="http://104.207.159.135:4567/topic/12/ooc-incursion">here.</a></p></section>

<h3>Lower Decks: &quot;I Feel the Need... (Rigel Cup 2390)&quot;</h3>
<a href="http://104.207.159.135:4567/topic/14/i-feel-the-need-rigel-cup-2390">Go to the mission!</a></br>
With teams from across the quadrant, the Rigel Cup is one of the most prestigious aerobatics competitions in the known galaxy. While the Blue Eagles, commanded by the notoriously cocky Andorian fighter pilot Shusas sh’Tari seem confident of victory, a team from Starfleet Academy known as Delta Squad and led by Cadet Sera Williams plan to give them a run for their money… For more info go <a href="http://104.207.159.135:4567/topic/13/ooc-rigel-cup-2390">here.</a></p></section>
